It's distinctive golden cartridge, battery-backed memory and epic storyline clearly showed that this was no normal game. The Legend of Zelda paved the way for other influential titles, such as Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy, which would go on to be critically-acclaimed series themselves, their roots forgotten as technology advanced. But it all goes back to The Legend of Zelda.</p> <p>The original Zelda was followed in 1989 by Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Though a controversial addition to the series, it was nevertheless an important one. It's side-scrolling and role-playing elements, and removed emphasis on Link's inventory clearly showed what worked and what didn't in the series. When A Link to the Past debuted on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, it returned to classic Legend of Zelda gameplay.</p> <p>Though A Link to the Past restored Zelda to it's roots, it took it much farther. Link's inventory was tripled, and the overworld of the original (already modestly large, even by today's standards) was expanded by an unbelievable factor. The Legend of Zelda was a hit game; A Link to the Past pushed Zelda into legendary status. Even today, almost fifteen years later, A Link to the Past is still considered one of the greatest games ever produced, standing up to scrutiny and the tests of time far longer then it's fellows.</p> <p>Link's first foray into the handheld market was in the critically-acclaimed \"Link's Awakening\" for the classic Game Boy. Amazingly, despite the Game Boy's limited technological potential, Link's Awakening felt more like a minimized- version of A Link to the Past instead of a cheap knockoff of the original Zelda. The game even made tentative steps to retry Zelda's hand at side- scrolling, with surprisingly fun results. As one of the first Game Boy games to demonstrate that a handheld title could have actual depth and character to it, Link had proven once again that the Legend of Zelda was the series of innovation.</p> <p>The series entered it's longest time of stagnation ever at this point. It wasn't until 1997 that The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released for the Nintendo 64. Needless to say, the wait was worth it, as with it's fellows A Link to the Past and the original Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time was critically acclaimed and set the standard for what future Action games should be. Indeed, Ocarina of Time's pioneering Z-Targeting system was soon copied by just about every action game on the market. But, as with so many things ripped off from competing titles, these adaptations failed miserably. Even to this day, the best Z-Targeting is still found in the Zelda Series, and Ocarina of Time is regularly awarded the title of \"Best Game Ever\" by gaming publications worldwide.</p> <p>Ocarina's enduring gameplay and revolutionary engine has since spawned a veritable cabbage-industry of knockoffs, safely marking it as every bit as influential as the original Legend of Zelda. With the lessons that Nintendo had learned from Super Mario 64 (itself considered one of the great 3-D Platforming titles), Zelda had managed to recreate itself for the third time. Following quickly in Ocarina's footsteps came Majora's Mask, whose rapid release following Ocarina was attributed largely to the fact that it used the already created Ocarina game engine.</p> <p>But that didn't stop Ocarina; it remained one of the best selling games of all time right to the end of the N64's lifespan. It has even been re-released not once, but twice for the Gamecube (once as a bundle in the Zelda Collector's Edition, and once in the Ocarina of Time/Master Quest bundle with The Wind Waker). As if to prove Ocarina's enduring legacy and rabid fanbase, these two titles are incredibly difficult to find, and have absurd price tags attached to them when you do. A used Collector's Edition in good condition will fetch fifty dollars easily, the same price as a brand new game.</p> <p>Though The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is nearing it's tenth anniversary as I write this, it's legacy continues and pervades every action title imaginable in even the remotest way. And so I honor the game, the series, and the legend with this guide, what my own manic ambitions desire to be the greatest Ocarina of Time guide ever written.</p> <p>Go me.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#hyrule-overworld","title":"Hyrule Overworld","text":"<p>Most Zelda games take place in the land of Hyrule, and Ocarina of Time possesses the most fully realized and complete version of this mythical land. Like most fictional worlds, Hyrule doesn't try to hide the fact that it is actually just a smattering of Earthly-locales put together to form a coherent, living place. It contains a single forest, a single mountain, a single river, a single lake, a single plain... you get the idea.</p> <p>At the start of the game, players take control of Link, a young Kokiri (think Elves crossed with Hobbits). The Kokiri live together in a small, protected section of the Lost Woods known as \"The Kokiri Forest.\" Ruled by their benevolent demigod, The Deku Tree, the Kokiri live together in peaceful harmony. In the midst of the Lost Woods there is a meadow, the Sacred Forest Meadow, which some Kokiri are known to visit periodically. In the midst of this meadow is the Forest Temple.</p> <p>North of the Lost Woods is the land of the Zoras. Ruled over by their King, and worshipping the immortal fish Jabu-Jabu, the Zoras rule the waters of Hyrule. In addition to their mystic fountain and the aquatic caverns that make their home, the Zora call Zora's River in the east and Lake Hylia in the south their home. Deep beneath Lake Hylia lies the Water Temple.</p> <p>North of Lake Hylia, there exists a rocky, rugged valley that is home to the Gerudos. The Gerudos are an earthy, secretive race whose people are mostly female. Only a single male Gerudo is born every one hundred years. Ocarina's villain, Ganondorf, hails from this land. Built on the other side of a narrow canyon, the Gerudo's have a mighty fortress that they call home. The Fortress borders along a desert, known only as the Haunted Wasteland. Hidden in the midst of the Haunted Wasteland is the Desert Colossus, an ancient oasis and home of the Gerudos. The Desert Colossus is actually revealed to be the Spirit Temple.</p> <p>In the northeast corner of Hyrule is the village of Kakariko. Originally a home to the reclusive Sheikah tribe, with the slow demise of their tribe more and more Hylians have taken up residence there. Despite the new presence of the Hylians, dark secrets of the Sheikah still reside buried beneath the town and the graveyard behind it. Kakariko Village is nestled at the foot of Death Mountain, Hyrule's resident active volcano. Home to a race of rock-like creatures known as the Gorons, the mountain is also home to other, more unpleasant creatures, such as the Dodongos. The Fire Temple is found in the middle of Death Mountain's active crater.</p> <p>To the west of Death Mountain lies Hyrule Castle. Home to the Hylians, and Hyrule's namesake, Hyrule Castle contains a Market, and housing for the citizens of Hyrule and it's Royal Family. Princess Zelda and her family reside here as well. All of Hyrule is connected by a vast, sparsely forested field, and in the middle of this field is Lon Lon Ranch. Home to Talon, his daughter Malon and their assistant, Ingo, Lon Lon Ranch provides the horses that the Hylians use to cross the field.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#dungeons-of-hyrule","title":"Dungeons of Hyrule","text":"<p>In each of the five environments of Hyrule, there exists a Temple which is aligned to the people of that land. In the densely forested Lost Woods, there is the Forest Temple. In the midst of the burning embers of Death Mountain Crater, there is the Fire Temple. Underneath the surface of Lake Hylia is the Water Temple. Buried beneath the Kakariko Graveyard is the Shadow Temple. Deep within the rugged Gerudo Desert is the Spirit Temple. Aside from these five mystic temples, home to five of the six Spiritual Sages, there are also smaller dwellings of evil creatures.</p> <p>Both the Deku Tree and the Zora Demi-god Jabu-Jabu have been cursed by evil creatures, and only by traveling into their interiors will Link be able to defeat the evil monsters and free the Deku Tree and Jabu-Jabu from the enchantment. Deep within Death Mountain, there is a cavern where the Gorons harvest the \"Special Crop\" that sustains them. Recently, a pack of ferocious animals have taken up residence in this cavern, leaving the Gorons starving and their spirits broken. Hidden beneath Kakariko Village lies the remnants of an ancient Sheikah temple, which has been overrun by the undead. And in the mystic fountain of the Zoras, there is a frigid cavern which threatens to destroy the home of the Zora.</p> <p>With nine dungeons, two mini-dungeons and one optional dungeon, Ocarina of Time has the largest number of dungeons of any Zelda title, past or present. Though they are not as challenging as the dungeons that appeared in Majora's Mask, nor as lengthy as the dungeons of Wind Waker, the dungeons of Ocarina of Time more then make up for this by being numerous and diverse.</p> <p>Each dungeon of the game is built around one central theme - such as the interior of a fish, or a dungeon based around water or fire - and though there are numerous puzzles to be solved, each dungeon has one \"Big Puzzle\" which must be completed to access the boss and complete the dungeon.</p> <p>In the game's first dungeon, Inside the Deku Tree, players must open up passages in the Deku Tree's main chamber, climbing from the Tree's top to it's bottom, finally reaching the Tree's roots and defeating the parasite that is sapping it's strength. In Dodongo's Cavern, players must climb to the top of a massive Dodongo's skull and force it's mouth open, opening a passage to the King Dodongo. In Jabu-Jabu's Belly, players must destroy parasitic tentacles that sap Jabu-Jabu's strength, finally revealing a path to the parasite in Jabu-Jabu's brain.</p> <p>In the Forest Temple, players must track down and kill four elusive Poes who have stolen magic flames, which open the passage to the boss chamber. In the Fire Temple, players must climb clear to the top of the massive structure, in order to create a bridge to the boss at the bottom of the Temple. In the Water Temple, players must proactively raise and lower the water level in the Temple in order to reach the different areas of the dungeon (a Temple which, may I add, has irked Ocarina players for over a decade).</p> <p>In the Shadow Temple, players must cross great expanses of deadly traps in an almost Indiana Jones-esque environment. In the Spirit Temple, players have to travel through time in order to complete both wings of the dungeon. And lastly, in Ganon's Castle, players must destroy the six Seals in the Keep. Each Seal is stored in a room which echoes one of the six Temples of the land (The Light Temple, which is not an accessible Temple in the game, is also represented here by the Light Seal).</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#young-link-and-adult-link","title":"Young Link and Adult Link","text":"<p>At the start of Ocarina of Time, Link is a young Kokiri, living amidst the playful Kokiri tribe. The Kokiri are completely protected by the benevolent Deku Tree, who hides the forest from outsiders and protects the Kokiri from the dangerous monsters of the Lost Woods. But almost as soon as the game begins, this fragile protection is shattered by the death of the Deku Tree. With his forest home now in danger, Link sets out to fulfill the last wishes of the Great Deku Tree: To find the Princess of Destiny, and the three Spiritual Stones, before the Gerudo Thief Ganondorf does.</p> <p>But after a hearty adventure gathering the Spiritual Stones and covering every inch of Hyrule with his footsteps, Link discovers that his adventure has only just begun. After opening the Door of Time and drawing the Master Sword from it's pedestal, Young Link immediately finds himself awakening seven years in the future, and he has become a full-grown Adult. What's more, thanks to the magic of the Master Sword and the Ocarina of Time, Link gains the ability to travel back and forth between his childhood and his adulthood, simply by visiting the Temple of Time. He has now truly become the Hero of Time.</p> <p>Actions that Link performs as a child, be it planting a magic bean, uncovering a new item, or forging a special bond with a denizen of Hyrule directly affect the future. And conversely, knowledge that Link acquires as an adult can be carried to the past, letting Young Link travel to faraway locales normally unavailable to him. This, in turn, lets Young Link perform new actions, plant new magic beans, uncover new items, forge new special bonds, etc., which then directly affect the future. The concept of time travel is deeply ingrained in Ocarina of Time's gameplay.</p> <p>On a more technical level, this concept of time travel provides some truly intriguing twists in the gameplay. Adult Link, for example, has access to far more items then Young Link, and his items and weapons are also far more powerful. This lets him reach corners of Hyrule completely unreachable with Young Link. However, Young Link's smaller size, and the undisturbed peace of Hyrule in it's prime, let's him access some areas which are closed to Adult Link. Mastering the nuances of both versions of Link, and learning when each one needs to be used to get past certain obstacles, lets the player reach hidden Heart Pieces and Gold Skulltulas.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#links-inventory","title":"Link's Inventory","text":"<p>Though his inventory in Ocarina of Time is not as large or varied as it was in A Link to the Past, this is due more to the fact that Ocarina doesn't have quite as many superfluos items that you use once, and then forget they exist. In a nutshell, Ocarina has fewer items then Link to the Past, but they are used better, so we forgive them.</p> <p>All of Link's classic items from previous games return - the Bow and Arrows and Bombs, a staple since the original title, return in all their glory. The now- famous Hookshot from A Link to the Past, arguably the most brilliantly conceived item in the entire series, returns for Ocarina, reworked for it's three dimensional environment. Even A Link to the Past's oft-ignored Magic Hammer returns for Ocarina, though this time around it has become the Megaton Hammer, and is so massive even Adult Link has difficulty in wielding it. New items in the series include the unorthodox and under-utilized Bombchus (which crawl along walls and ceilings in a straight line before finally exploding), and the Lens of Truth (which reveals things for what they truly are, making the invisible visible, and the fake disappear).</p> <p>In A Link to the Past, Link had upgradeable equipment, but never on the level that appears in Ocarina. Obtaining new Armor in A Link to the Past enhanced Link's defense. In Ocarina, new tunics grant Link the ability to breath underwater or withstand tremendous heat, and the player can change between available tunics at will. Also in A Link to the Past, upgrading Link's sword or shield to their next level was a permanent upgrade. In Ocarina, players can choose which sword or shield they choose to wield, as each provides unique advantages and disadvantages for both Young Link and Adult Link.</p> <p>The Kokiri Sword, which is little more then a large knife, is the only weapon small enough for Young Link to brandish. But as Adult Link, players can choose to use the Master Sword, or the Biggoron's Sword. The Master Sword is a sturdy weapon, which is light enough to wield with a shield. The Biggoron's Sword, on the other hand, is so massive that Adult Link can't use a shield while wielding it, and has such a wide reach that the blade is impossible to use in narrow corridors. Even the way Young Link and Adult Link use the Hylian Shield is markedly different. Though both can equip the shield, it is too big for Young Link to actually use, and he instead has to resort to hiding under it like a shell.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#music-in-ocarina-of-time","title":"Music in Ocarina of Time","text":"<p>Music has been a staple of the series since it's inception, and has slowly developed over the ever-expanding list of titles. In the original Legend of Zelda, the Magic Flute was used to warp around the Hyrule Overworld, and was even instrumental in defeating certain bosses. In Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the flute had a much reduced but still significant role in defeating enemies. A Link to the Past saw the Magic Flute (still called a Flute, even though by that time it had evolved fully into the Ocarina we know today) being used to summon a helpful bird that would carry Link to different corners of Hyrule. Link's Awakening saw the first introduction of multiple songs available for the Flute, but Ocarina of Time takes the magical flute and turns it from novelty item into full-blown musical instrument.</p> <p>Though the Ocarina is just that: an Ocarina, the different songs that can be played on it are key to finishing the game. One of the first songs you learn, Zelda's Lullaby, is used by Young Link to show his allegiance to the Hyrule Royal Family to the Gorons and Zoras, and is later used by Adult Link in the dungeons and other hidden locations of Hyrule. Epona's Song is the only way to obtain Epona, Link's legendary horse. The Sun's Song possesses the power to turn day into night, and night into day. The Song of Storm's can summon storms to Link's location.</p> <p>But the Ocarina is used more then to just play music; later, he can use it to travel instantaneously between different locations in Hyrule. This is pivotal in allowing Young Link to bypass certain obstacles (such as an impassable barrier of rock, or particularly stubborn guards) and reach some of the more elusive locales in Hyrule. Though the Ocarina seems a small and seemingly expendable trinket, it's one of the most endearing and important items in the game.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#sword-combat-and-z-targeting","title":"Sword Combat and Z-Targeting","text":"<p>At the start of his journey, Link is joined by a Fairy called Navi. Navi, sent specially to Link by the Deku Tree, acts as his friend and companion through his adventure. Though sometimes annoyingly persistent in calling Link's attention (Hey! Hey! Listen! Hey!), Navi nevertheless performs a pivotal action in the game: Z-Targeting.</p> <p>Constantly copied by Zelda's competitors, but never as faithfully or brilliantly conceived as it appears in the Zelda series, Z-Targeting allows Link to focus his attention on a single target, and radically alters his moveset to focus on combat. While in free-form camera mode, the A Button makes Link interact with objects in his environment. While Z-Targeted, however, it causes Link to perform different jumping actions. Jumping to the left or right will strafe in a circle around the enemy, while a backwards jump will make Link do a backflip. A jump while holding forward causes Link to perform the Jump Attack, the most powerful attack in his repertoire.</p> <p>While in free-form camera mode, the R Button activates Link's shield. However, it also makes him completely stationary. While Z-Targeted, however, holding the R button will tell Link to raise his shield, but he still maintains his mobility. Even the Sword's attacks change while Z-Targeted. While in free- form mode, tapping the B Button will cause Link to perform a sideways, sweeping attack. While Z-Targeted, however, this attack becomes a downward plunge. Holding forward and B will cause Link to stab, or a whole new assortment of cool attacks. Even Prince of Persia's \"Free-Form Fighting System\" isn't nearly as flexible or fun as Ocarina's Z-Targeted battles... at least in this author's opinion.</p> <p>Mastering the nuances of blocking with the shield, dodging with different jumping maneuvers, and attacking in many different methods provides a unique, simple, yet engaging combat experience, one which few other action games in existence can challenge.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#gold-skulltulas-and-pieces-of-heart","title":"Gold Skulltulas and Pieces of Heart","text":"<p>Like so many concepts that just plain worked since the original title, Zelda games are filled with lots of optional upgrades to find to enhance Link. Though in the original game this was limited to four hidden Heart Containers in the Overworld, since then the hidden items have grown to include the quintessential Pieces of Heart, the always-elusive Fourth Bottle, and usually some kind of hidden item to be gathered for rewards. This started in Link's Awakening with the Secret Seashells, and Ocarina of Time continues that tradition with one hundred Gold Skulltulas hidden throughout Hyrule.</p> <p>Hidden in both time periods of the game in roughly equal portions, the Gold Skulltulas are the symbols of a curse that affects a wealthy family in Kakariko Village. There are six members in the family total, and finding, destroying, and taking the magic token from enough Gold Skulltulas will free one of the family members from his curse. Visiting the House of Skulltula at that point will get Link some kind of special item, usually beneficial, sometimes laughably useless. Finding all one hundred Gold Skulltulas is perhaps the most ominously difficult task in the game, as some of them require absurd amounts of backtracking (sometimes even returning to previously completed dungeons) to track them down.</p> <p>Ocarina also honors it's predecessors with the inclusion of thirty-six hidden Pieces of Heart. Each Piece of Heart represents one-quarter of a Heart Container, and gathering four Pieces of Heart rewards the player with an additional Heart Container. With thirty-six total Pieces of Heart hidden around Hyrule, that amounts to nine of the game's twenty available Heart Containers from Pieces of Heart.</p> <p>Both Gold Skulltulas and Pieces of Heart are hidden in both periods of Link's life, and some of the more fiendishly difficult ones actually require the player to accomplish goals in both time periods to reach them. But, in typical Nintendo fashion, these goals are never so perplexing or challenging as to be overly annoying to complete. A 100% completed Ocarina of Time game file is truly something to be proud of.</p>"},{"location":"game_basics/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time marks a milestone in gaming.

The only real tricks she has over these basic enemies is considerably more health, the ability to climb walls, and the ability to create Gohma Larva to distract you. Defeating Gohma is rather easy (and can, in fact, be done by only stunning her twice if you know how to do it properly). To stun Gohma and make her vulnerable to basic sword attacks, you must shoot her in the eye with the Slingshot while her eye glows red. As soon as the fight begins, immediately Z-target Gohma. Gohma usually immediately begins her charge attack, so immediately shoot her in the eye with the Slingshot, then begin using Jump Attacks (remember to swing your sword at least once before trying to do a jump attack). After one or two attacks, Gohma will run away and crawl up the ceiling.</p> <p>Keeping Gohma Z-Targeted, try to keep yourself positioned so that you can see her eye even while she is on the ceiling. At this point she will begin spawning Gohma Larva, who will drop down to fight you. If you can shoot her in the eye before she is able spawn them, however, then she will fall to the floor and be stunned for a VERY long time.

Jump across the lake and follow the path to the western edge of Kokiri Forest.  The Kokiri who originally blocked your path here is now gone, so you can exit through the hollowed log.  Go through to leave the Kokiri Forest.</p> <p>Lost Woods New Item: Fairy Ocarina</p> <p>As you pass over the bridge leading to Hyrule Field, you will come across Saria.  She accepts that Link is leaving, and gives him the Fairy Ocarina as a parting gift.  The game will automatically zone you into the next area.</p> <p>Hyrule Field</p> <p>Take a few steps forward, and simultaneously the best and most annoying character in the game will stop you: Kaepora Gaebora.  He'll explain how to get to Hyrule Castle, and also how your map works.  Make sure you tell him \"Yes,\" you got all that, unless you want him to repeat the entire spiel.</p> <p>Once KG flies away, run forward between the trees where the beginnings of a road appear.  Follow the road to it's end to reach Hyrule Castle.  Make sure you roll all the way (by continually pressing the A button as you run), otherwise it will be night time by the time you reach Hyrule Castle, and the gates will be closed.  At which point you'll have to sit around for the next few minutes waiting for time to pass.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)</p> <p>Once you gain access to Hyrule Castle, immediately enter the gatehouse to your left as you enter.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Gatehouse (daytime) [GS004] New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1</p> <p>Smash all of the pots in this room with your sword, then destroy the crates in the rear of the room by rolling into them.  One of them contains a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it, and take the token it leaves behind.  Then leave the Gatehouse.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)</p> <p>Go southwest to the next area.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)</p> <p>Head around to the opposite side of the fountain, and speak with the little girl in the white dress.  This is Malon, another important bit character. After you've spoken with Malon, enter the building behind her with the large target over the door.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Shooting Gallery (daytime) New Equipment: Bullet Bag x40</p> <p>Speak with the rather large and hairy clerk, and agree to play the game.  To win the Big Bullet Bag, you have to shoot every rupee that appears without missing a single one.  If you miss two or less, then the clerk will let you try again for free.  If you miss more then two, you have to pay to play again.</p> <p>For this first run through the Shooting Gallery, the rupees appear in a preset order.  The order is:</p> <p>1.)  In the middle 2.)  From the left, then from the right 3.)  Jumps from the middle 4.)  From the left AND right 5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left 6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right</p> <p>Keep playing the minigame until you successfully shoot all of the targets, and the clerk will award you with the Bullet Bag x40, which increases the ammo capacity of your Slingshot by 10.  If you run out of rupees trying to complete the game, then return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse and smash the pots to replenish your supplies.</p> <p>Bullet Bag in hand, return to the Market.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)</p> <p>Leave the market through the passage directly behind Malon.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Garden (daytime) [GS005] New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1</p> <p>Run forward a short ways, where Kaepora Gaebora will appear again.  Listen to his rant about guards, then when he flies away roll into his tree to make a Gold Skulltula appear.  Now, you'll have to hang around here until it becomes nighttime.  Once it does, head back to the Market.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Market (nighttime)</p> <p>Run back around, towards the entrance to the Market from the Drawbridge.  Run behind the little stall to the left, and you should coax a small white dog into following you.  If you accidentally attract the attention of another dog, leave the area and re-enter it.  Once you have the dog following you, run to the right and into the alley in the far right corner.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Back Alley (nighttime)</p> <p>Enter the door second on your left.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Little Richard's House (nighttime) New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP01]</p> <p>Speak with the big fat lady in this house, and she will recognize the lost dog as her own.  She'll reward you with a Piece of Heart for finding Little Richard (good golly, miss molly!).  Go back out to the Back Alley and return to the Garden.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Garden New Item: Weird Egg, Chicken</p> <p>Malon should now be standing near a long vine on the wall to your right.  If she isn't standing there, then you didn't speak with her back in the Market. You'll have to return there, speak to her again, then return to the Garden and wait for another Day/Night cycle to pass, then return to the Market, then return to the Garden, where Malon should have appeared.</p> <p>Speak with Malon, and she'll explain that her father, Talon, went to the castle to deliver Milk, but hasn't returned yet.  He probably fell asleep somewhere around the castle, and she asks that you go and find him.  There's a catch, though; the guards in the Garden won't look to kindly upon some kid in a green fairy costume sneaking into the castle grounds.  If they spot you, they'll grab you and throw you back outside the gate.  Malon also gives you an Egg, for no apparent reason.  You'll need the Chicken inside the egg to wake Talon, however, so accept it with gratitude.</p> <p>Climb up the ivy wall to the top (it has some rough spots where if you don't climb up in just the right place, you'll fall off).  At the top, run forward a bit, past the gossip stone, to the top of the large marble arch.  Drop down to the ground on the other side of the arch, where you will land on the other side of the gate which formerly blocked your path.  You probably don't realize it, but you've already snuck past two of the guards.</p> <p>This next part is the easily the hardest part of sneaking through the Garden. You need to run up the hill to the left at an exact angle.  There are three graphical breaks in the hill (thank god for N64's visible sprites, otherwise this would be nearly impossible to describe).  The place you need to run up is the third break in the hill, approximately near it's center.  Go straight up the hill, and at the top there is a cluster of flowers.  Run straight at these flowers, then begin running forward and slightly to the left until you reach a wall.  Part of the wall is tiled with some bricks; climb up these bricks.</p> <p>At the top of the brick wall, run straight forward, past another gossip stone. Jump straight off the cliff, and go right into the moat.  Swim down to the end of the moat until it breaks left, then climb up onto the small patch of dirt, and from there climb up to the stone platform.  Run to the left from the stone platform, where you will find Talon fast asleep.  If it turned from night to day in the time it took you to sneak past the guards, then the Egg that Malon gave you should have hatched into a Chicken.  If it hasn't hatched yet, you'll have to stand around until it does.  Stand near Talon so that Navi flutters near him, then use the Chicken to wake him up.</p> <p>Speak with Talon, and he will suddenly remember that he left Malon behind. He'll run off, clearing the path for you to push the milk crates near Talon into position so that you can sneak in through the castle moat.  Push both of the milk crates through the gap which was recently vacated by Talon.  You can then climb onto the crates, and then jump over to the draining pipe which feeds the moat.  If it's nighttime, then loiter around until it becomes daytime.  You won't be able to sneak through the next area at night, as the guard is increased at night.  Once it's daytime, climb through the drainage pipe to enter the next area.</p> <p>Hyrule Castle - Courtyard (daytime) New Item: Zelda's Letter New Song: Zelda's Lullaby</p> <p>Jump to the left, out of the small fountain.  Run to the left until the camera changes to a small garden, with a patrolling guard in it.  Hiding behind the tall hedge to stay hidden from the guard (if you are seen here, you'll be thrown back to the milk crate area in the Hyrule Castle Garden).  Wait for the guard to begin moving along the left side of the topiary in the center, then quickly run across the bottom edge of the topiary, and left until the camera shifts again.</p> <p>Here, a pair of guards patrol a pair of fountains.  Again, hide behind the hedge on the right side of the screen until the guards move into the proper configuration for you to run by.  The time to run past, again along the bottom edge, is when the left guard is walking between the pair of fountains, and the right guard is walking along the upper edge of the right fountain.  Run to the left until the camera shifts.</p> <p>Try to ignore the rupees in the center of this topiary.  They're tempting, but there actually isn't very many and the guard here guards them well.  Instead, climb to the top of the topiary by going up the stairs, then slowly walk along the wooden beam which extends over the topiary.  If you fall, it is possible to make it back to hiding if you're extremely quick, but not likely.  On the other side of the topiary, run to the left until the camera changes once more.</p> <p>Hide behind the stone wall until the guards move into the proper configuration to sneak by.  This time around, wait for the left guard to begin walking along the left side of the statue, and for the right guard to begin moving along the upper side of the statue.  Run to the left and take refuge behind another hedge.</p> <p>Wait for both of the guards to pass along the left side of the topiary, and follow slowly behind the second guard as he moves along.  Stop when he stops, move when he moves.  As long as you stay directly behind him, he won't spot you.  Once you reach the northern edge of the topiary, run through the arch to reach the center of the Courtyard, and the Princess of Destiny: Zelda.</p> <p>Before you run up and talk to Zelda, there are two easter eggs in the courtyard you may want to check out.  Shoot the window on the left side of the courtyard with your Slingshot, and a guard will throw a bomb at you.  Look at the window on the right, and you'll see images of Mario, Peach, Bowser and Yoshi.  Shoot this window for a red rupee.  After you've done this, speak with Zelda.</p> <p>Zelda will ask you if you have the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  Even though you promised the Deku Tree you wouldn't tell anyone, it's okay to tell Zelda. Confirm that you have it.  Zelda will then tell you about a dream she had, and offers to tell you an ancient story passed down by the royal family - but only if you don't tell anyone.  Promise not to tell, and she'll basically repeat the ending to the Deku Tree's story.  She will then mention the Ocarina of Time and the Temple of Time, then ask if you understand.  Say you do, whether you do or not.  Zelda will then stand aside and let you see Ganondorf in person for the first time (the dream sequence doesn't count!).  Agree to look through the window, and Ganondorf will see you out of the corner of his eye.  Zelda will then beg Link to help her save Hyrule from Ganondorf.  Agree to help her, and she will give you Zelda's Letter.  This will let you pass through the gate in Kakariko Village to Death Mountain.</p> <p>Run towards the entrance to the courtyard, and you will find the way blocked by Impa, Zelda's attendant (basically, nurse/bodyguard).  Impa will teach you Zelda's Lullaby, easily the most important and overused song in the game.  Impa will then show you back outside to Hyrule Field, and point you in the direction of Kakariko Village.  But we're not ready to go there just yet.  Navi recommends that we go and brag to Saria about how we're going to save the world, which is actually a pretty good idea.  We'll be making a quick stop at Lon Lon Ranch along the way as well.</p>"},{"location":"walkthrough/sidequests/biggeron/","title":"Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest","text":"<p>The Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest is the Adult Link equivalent of the Young Link Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest.

Given that the entire game can be beaten, and beaten easily, without obtaining Epona, it's not unusual for younger or casual players to completely miss their opportunity without realizing it.</p> <p>In order to ride Epona, and later take her from the Ingo-controlled Lon Lon Ranch, you must first learn Epona's Song from Malon as Young Link. This can be done at any time after meeting Zelda and learning Zelda's Lullaby. Head for Lon Lon Ranch during the daytime, and head for the middle of the pasture. Speak with Malon until she mentions her mother, then pull out your Ocarina (Fairy Ocarina, Ocarina of Time, it doesn't matter which). Malon will then teach you Epona's Song, which tames Epona and also makes any Cow in the game give you a free bottle of Lon Lon Milk.</p> <p>Fast forward to Adult Link. This next step can be done at any time after becoming Adult Link, and can even be the very first thing you do once you arrive. Run to the pasture in the rear of the ranch, and speak with Ingo. After a lengthy speech about how great Ganondorf is, Ingo will offer to let you ride a horse for ten rupees. Do so, and you will be allowed into the pasture. Ignore the horse that Ingo offers you, and play Epona's Song. Epona will appear and run towards you. This is where it gets tricky; you can't take Epona just yet. Ride out your time in the pasture, then speak with Ingo again. Agree to ride again, and this time speak to Ingo while riding Epona and he will challenge you to a race for fifty rupees.</p> <p>At this point, you and Ingo will both appear on the track around the pasture riding your horses. In the first race against Ingo, he goes fairly slowly, and takes the corners very wide. Stay close behind him until he gets near a corner, then quickly hug the inside rail and burn two or three carrots to shoot in front of him. At this point, just carefully steer yourself to stay directly in front Ingo, preventing him from getting in front of you. You don't even have to use carrots. If he gets in front of you, wait for Ingo to take the next wide corner and shoot in front of him again.</p> <p>After you win the first race, Ingo will have a meltdown and frantically bet Epona on a rematch. Agree. This time, Ingo will cheat and leave the starting gate a second before the clock goes off. Even though he now goes slightly faster and cheats at the start, the race is still identical, and he still takes turns incredibly wide. Wait for the first turn in the track, and burn two or three carrots to shoot in front of him while he takes the wide corner. Now, it's a simple matter of staying in front of him and blocking his progress forward. The occasional use of a carrot may be necessary.</p> <p>After the race, Ingo will honor his bet and give you Epona. But he also will close the gate to the Ranch and refuse to let you leave. You'll have to jump the gate using Epona. Return to the track going around the pasture, and run around it in a counter-clockwise direction (the opposite direction you go in the race). Use one carrot, then wait for it to regenerate, then use it again, to keep your speed up. When you reach the last turn in the course and can see the gate directly in front of you, burn all six of your carrots at once and run straight at the gate. If you aim yourself properly you'll soar right over the gate and Epona will now be yours to use in Hyrule Field, Lake Hylia, Gerudo Valley and Lon Lon Ranch.
