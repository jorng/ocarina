</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Kokiri Forest</p>
<p>You will emerge back near the entrance to the Kokiri Forest township.  Mido is
once again blocking your path, so speak to him.  Mido will blame you for the
Deku Tree's death, the take off, presumably to sulk somewhere.  Jump across the
lake and follow the path to the western edge of Kokiri Forest.  The Kokiri who
originally blocked your path here is now gone, so you can exit through the
hollowed log.  Go through to leave the Kokiri Forest.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lost Woods
New Item: Fairy Ocarina</p>
<p>As you pass over the bridge leading to Hyrule Field, you will come across
Saria.  She accepts that Link is leaving, and gives him the Fairy Ocarina as a
parting gift.  The game will automatically zone you into the next area.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Field</p>
<p>Take a few steps forward, and simultaneously the best and most annoying
character in the game will stop you: Kaepora Gaebora.  He'll explain how to get
to Hyrule Castle, and also how your map works.  Make sure you tell him "Yes,"
you got all that, unless you want him to repeat the entire spiel.</p>
<p>Once KG flies away, run forward between the trees where the beginnings of a
road appear.  Follow the road to it's end to reach Hyrule Castle.  Make sure
you roll all the way (by continually pressing the A button as you run),
otherwise it will be night time by the time you reach Hyrule Castle, and the
gates will be closed.  At which point you'll have to sit around for the next
few minutes waiting for time to pass.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)</p>
<p>Once you gain access to Hyrule Castle, immediately enter the gatehouse to your
left as you enter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Gatehouse (daytime) [GS004]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1</p>
<p>Smash all of the pots in this room with your sword, then destroy the crates in
the rear of the room by rolling into them.  One of them contains a Gold
Skulltula.  Kill it, and take the token it leaves behind.  Then leave the
Gatehouse.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)</p>
<p>Go southwest to the next area.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)</p>
<p>Head around to the opposite side of the fountain, and speak with the little
girl in the white dress.  This is Malon, another important bit character.
After you've spoken with Malon, enter the building behind her with the large
target over the door.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Shooting Gallery (daytime)
New Equipment: Bullet Bag x40</p>
<p>Speak with the rather large and hairy clerk, and agree to play the game.  To
win the Big Bullet Bag, you have to shoot every rupee that appears without
missing a single one.  If you miss two or less, then the clerk will let you try
again for free.  If you miss more then two, you have to pay to play again.</p>
<p>For this first run through the Shooting Gallery, the rupees appear in a preset
order.  The order is:</p>
<p>1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right</p>
<p>Keep playing the minigame until you successfully shoot all of the targets, and
the clerk will award you with the Bullet Bag x40, which increases the ammo
capacity of your Slingshot by 10.  If you run out of rupees trying to complete
the game, then return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse and smash the pots to
replenish your supplies.</p>
<p>Bullet Bag in hand, return to the Market.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)</p>
<p>Leave the market through the passage directly behind Malon.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Garden (daytime) [GS005]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1</p>
<p>Run forward a short ways, where Kaepora Gaebora will appear again.  Listen to
his rant about guards, then when he flies away roll into his tree to make a
Gold Skulltula appear.  Now, you'll have to hang around here until it becomes
nighttime.  Once it does, head back to the Market.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Market (nighttime)</p>
<p>Run back around, towards the entrance to the Market from the Drawbridge.  Run
behind the little stall to the left, and you should coax a small white dog into
following you.  If you accidentally attract the attention of another dog, leave
the area and re-enter it.  Once you have the dog following you, run to the
right and into the alley in the far right corner.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Back Alley (nighttime)</p>
<p>Enter the door second on your left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Little Richard's House (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP01]</p>
<p>Speak with the big fat lady in this house, and she will recognize the lost dog
as her own.  She'll reward you with a Piece of Heart for finding Little Richard
(good golly, miss molly!).  Go back out to the Back Alley and return to the
Garden.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Garden
New Item: Weird Egg, Chicken</p>
<p>Malon should now be standing near a long vine on the wall to your right.  If
she isn't standing there, then you didn't speak with her back in the Market.
You'll have to return there, speak to her again, then return to the Garden and
wait for another Day/Night cycle to pass, then return to the Market, then
return to the Garden, where Malon should have appeared.</p>
<p>Speak with Malon, and she'll explain that her father, Talon, went to the castle
to deliver Milk, but hasn't returned yet.  He probably fell asleep somewhere
around the castle, and she asks that you go and find him.  There's a catch,
though; the guards in the Garden won't look to kindly upon some kid in a green
fairy costume sneaking into the castle grounds.  If they spot you, they'll grab
you and throw you back outside the gate.  Malon also gives you an Egg, for no
apparent reason.  You'll need the Chicken inside the egg to wake Talon,
however, so accept it with gratitude.</p>
<p>Climb up the ivy wall to the top (it has some rough spots where if you don't
climb up in just the right place, you'll fall off).  At the top, run forward a
bit, past the gossip stone, to the top of the large marble arch.  Drop down to
the ground on the other side of the arch, where you will land on the other side
of the gate which formerly blocked your path.  You probably don't realize it,
but you've already snuck past two of the guards.</p>
<p>This next part is the easily the hardest part of sneaking through the Garden.
You need to run up the hill to the left at an exact angle.  There are three
graphical breaks in the hill (thank god for N64's visible sprites, otherwise
this would be nearly impossible to describe).  The place you need to run up is
the third break in the hill, approximately near it's center.  Go straight up
the hill, and at the top there is a cluster of flowers.  Run straight at these
flowers, then begin running forward and slightly to the left until you reach a
wall.  Part of the wall is tiled with some bricks; climb up these bricks.</p>
<p>At the top of the brick wall, run straight forward, past another gossip stone.
Jump straight off the cliff, and go right into the moat.  Swim down to the end
of the moat until it breaks left, then climb up onto the small patch of dirt,
and from there climb up to the stone platform.  Run to the left from the stone
platform, where you will find Talon fast asleep.  If it turned from night to
day in the time it took you to sneak past the guards, then the Egg that Malon
gave you should have hatched into a Chicken.  If it hasn't hatched yet, you'll
have to stand around until it does.  Stand near Talon so that Navi flutters
near him, then use the Chicken to wake him up.</p>
<p>Speak with Talon, and he will suddenly remember that he left Malon behind.
He'll run off, clearing the path for you to push the milk crates near Talon
into position so that you can sneak in through the castle moat.  Push both of
the milk crates through the gap which was recently vacated by Talon.  You can
then climb onto the crates, and then jump over to the draining pipe which feeds
the moat.  If it's nighttime, then loiter around until it becomes daytime.  You
won't be able to sneak through the next area at night, as the guard is
increased at night.  Once it's daytime, climb through the drainage pipe to
enter the next area.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hyrule Castle - Courtyard (daytime)
New Item: Zelda's Letter
New Song: Zelda's Lullaby</p>
<p>Jump to the left, out of the small fountain.  Run to the left until the camera
changes to a small garden, with a patrolling guard in it.  Hiding behind the
tall hedge to stay hidden from the guard (if you are seen here, you'll be
thrown back to the milk crate area in the Hyrule Castle Garden).  Wait for the
guard to begin moving along the left side of the topiary in the center, then
quickly run across the bottom edge of the topiary, and left until the camera
shifts again.</p>
<p>Here, a pair of guards patrol a pair of fountains.  Again, hide behind the
hedge on the right side of the screen until the guards move into the proper
configuration for you to run by.  The time to run past, again along the bottom
edge, is when the left guard is walking between the pair of fountains, and the
right guard is walking along the upper edge of the right fountain.  Run to the
left until the camera shifts.</p>
<p>Try to ignore the rupees in the center of this topiary.  They're tempting, but
there actually isn't very many and the guard here guards them well.  Instead,
climb to the top of the topiary by going up the stairs, then slowly walk along
the wooden beam which extends over the topiary.  If you fall, it is possible to
make it back to hiding if you're extremely quick, but not likely.  On the other
side of the topiary, run to the left until the camera changes once more.</p>
<p>Hide behind the stone wall until the guards move into the proper configuration
to sneak by.  This time around, wait for the left guard to begin walking along
the left side of the statue, and for the right guard to begin moving along the
upper side of the statue.  Run to the left and take refuge behind another
hedge.</p>
<p>Wait for both of the guards to pass along the left side of the topiary, and
follow slowly behind the second guard as he moves along.  Stop when he stops,
move when he moves.  As long as you stay directly behind him, he won't spot
you.  Once you reach the northern edge of the topiary, run through the arch to
reach the center of the Courtyard, and the Princess of Destiny: Zelda.</p>
<p>Before you run up and talk to Zelda, there are two easter eggs in the courtyard
you may want to check out.  Shoot the window on the left side of the courtyard
with your Slingshot, and a guard will throw a bomb at you.  Look at the window
on the right, and you'll see images of Mario, Peach, Bowser and Yoshi.  Shoot
this window for a red rupee.  After you've done this, speak with Zelda.</p>
<p>Zelda will ask you if you have the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  Even though you
promised the Deku Tree you wouldn't tell anyone, it's okay to tell Zelda.
Confirm that you have it.  Zelda will then tell you about a dream she had, and
offers to tell you an ancient story passed down by the royal family - but only
if you don't tell anyone.  Promise not to tell, and she'll basically repeat the
ending to the Deku Tree's story.  She will then mention the Ocarina of Time and
the Temple of Time, then ask if you understand.  Say you do, whether you do or
not.  Zelda will then stand aside and let you see Ganondorf in person for the
first time (the dream sequence doesn't count!).  Agree to look through the
window, and Ganondorf will see you out of the corner of his eye.  Zelda will
then beg Link to help her save Hyrule from Ganondorf.  Agree to help her, and
she will give you Zelda's Letter.  This will let you pass through the gate in
Kakariko Village to Death Mountain.</p>
<p>Run towards the entrance to the courtyard, and you will find the way blocked by
Impa, Zelda's attendant (basically, nurse/bodyguard).  Impa will teach you
Zelda's Lullaby, easily the most important and overused song in the game.  Impa
will then show you back outside to Hyrule Field, and point you in the direction
of Kakariko Village.  But we're not ready to go there just yet.  Navi
recommends that we go and brag to Saria about how we're going to save the
world, which is actually a pretty good idea.  We'll be making a quick stop at
Lon Lon Ranch along the way as well.</p>
