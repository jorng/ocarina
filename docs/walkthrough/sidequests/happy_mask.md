# Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest

![Happy Mask Salesman](/images/happy_mask.png){ align=right width=200 }

The Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest is the only Sidequest available to Young Link. The sidequest begins at the Happy Mask Shop in Hyrule Castle Market, at any time after the opening the gate to Death Mountain Trail. The Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest ultimately nets you the Mask of Truth, which lets you get hints from the Gossip Stones that dot Hyrule. It also lets you make a little money, but not much. The only thing you really get out of this sidequest which is worth mentioning is a Deku Stick and Deku Nut capacity upgrade, both of which are obtained in the Forest Stage (for more information on this, see Walkthrough or the Upgrades chapters).

## Mask #1: The Keaton Mask

|--------------|-----------|
| Borrow Price | 10 Rupees |
| Sell Price   | 15 Rupees |

This mask is in the shape of a Keaton's face. A Keaton is a popular mythological creature in Japanese lore. The Guard who buys this claims it's for his son, but he's the one who wears it all the time. The Guards buys it for more then it's worth, so you'll make a five rupee profit on it.

## Mask #2: The Skull Mask

|--------------|-----------|
| Borrow Price | 15 Rupees |
| Sell Price   | 10 Rupees |

This mask is in the shape of a Skull. The lone Skullkid in Lost Woods feels inadequate next to his friends, so sell him this mask to boost his ego. The Skull Mask also lets you access the Deku Stick capacity upgrade in the Forest Stage. The Skullkid buys the fifteen rupee mask for only ten rupees, so you lose five rupees on this one.

## Mask #3: The Spooky Mask

    Dampe's Fanboy in the Kakariko Graveyard (daytime only).

| Details      |           |
|--------------|-----------|
| Borrow Price | 30 Rupees |
| Sell Price   | 30 Rupees |

This mask is sold to Dampe's Fanboy, the little kid who walks around Kakariko Graveyard and pretends to be Dampe (he only appears during the day). You break even on this one; the mask sells for thirty rupees, and the boy buys it for thirty.

## Mask #4: The Bunny Hood

!!! abstract "Sold To"
    The Running Man in Hyrule Field (only after Jabu-Jabu's Belly is finished)

| Details      |            |
|--------------|------------|
| Borrow Price | 50 Rupees  |
| Sell Price   | 500 Rupees |

The Running Man appears in Hyrule Field after Dungeon III, Jabu-Jabu's Belly, has been finished. Once you find him, you'll have to chase him until he stops (the Sun's Song is no help). He'll buy the Hood for five hundred rupees, but if you don't have the Giant's Wallet then you'll only get 99 or 200 out of that five hundred.

## Mask #5: The Mask of Truth

The Mask of Truth, the best of the available masks, lets you use the Gossip Stones around Hyrule to receive hints. Which would be cool, except only Young Link can wear the Mask of Truth, and by the time you get the Mask, you're practically done with Young Link. The Mask of Truth can also be used in the Forest Stage to earn a Deku Nut capacity upgrade.

## Mask #6: The Goron Mask

When worn, this Masks makes those lovably foolish Gorons mistake you for an actual Goron, who will deplore about what a small, weak Goron you are, and insist you eat something. Ain't they the greatest?

## Mask #7: The Zora Mask

If you speak to Zoras while wearing this mask, they will sarcastically treat you the way you'd expect a little kid running around in a mask to be treated.

## Mask #8: The Gerudo Mask

If you thought this mask would actually fool any of the Gerudos, then go jump off a cliff.
