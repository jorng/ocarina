# Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest

The Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest is the Adult Link equivalent of the Young Link Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest. Well, calling it the equivalent isn't technically accurate, since it is much longer, harder, and the reward is actually "rewarding." The trading sequence can be completed immediately after obtaining Epona, and since Epona can be obtained immediately after becoming Adult Link, it is strongly recommended that you waste no time in getting the Biggoron Sword. It is especially useful in several upcoming Boss Fights, including Phantom Ganon and Morpha.

!!! warning
    Using any of the Transportation Songs (Prelude of Light, Minuet of Forest, etc.) will automatically set the timer on any _Timed Items_ to `0:01`. **DO NOT USE TRANSPORTATION SONGS WHILE DOING TIMED STEPS.** I'll say it again. **NO TRANSPORTATION SONGS ON TIMED STEPS. BAD NO NO BAD.** The Sun's Song is okay to use, though, even if it does end up transporting you back to the start of an area.

!!! info
    Several steps of the sequence, particularly Part IX, are much easier if you planted all of the Magic Beans as a Child.

As a last bit of advice, if you don't have Epona, don't even bother trying. Also, if you are doing this entire string in one go as soon as you acquire Epona, I **STRONGLY** recommend that you ignore any Heart Pieces and Gold Skulltulas along the way, and focus entirely on completing the quest chain. This will reduce confusion later on if you are following a guide (namely, this guide).

## Part I: The Pocket Egg and the Pocket Cucco

In order to obtain the Pocket Egg, head for Kakariko Village and speak with the Cucco Lady. She is standing near the pasture in the rear of town, near the entrance to the Kakariko Graveyard. Once you have the Pocket Egg, play the Sun's Song until the Pocket Egg hatches into the Pocket Cucco. Make sure that it is daytime, then enter the building at the bottom of the stairs near the middle of town. Talon is sleeping on the bed. Use the Pocket Cucco while standing near Talon, and he will awaken. If you've stolen Epona and liberated Lon Lon Ranch, then speak with Talon and he'll return to the Ranch (at which point you can return and complete a Time Trial minigame that nets you your own personal Cow). Otherwise, he'll just stand around. Return to the Cucco Lady and show her the Pocket Cucco, and she'll give you Cojiro, the Blue Cucco.

## Part II: Cojiro

Now that you have Cojiro, head for the Kokiri Forest and into the Lost Woods using the entrance behind Mido's House. Go left at the first crossroads to reach the clearing where the Lone Skull Kid used to dance as Young Link. The Skull Kid is gone, replaced by the Carpenter's Son. Show him Cojiro, and the Carpenter's Son will admit that he has been cursed, and the only cure is a Potion which must be made from an Odd Mushroom. He'll give you the Odd Mushroom.

## Part III: The Odd Mushroom Time Limit: 3:00

The Odd Mushroom is on a three minute time limit, so you have to high tail it back to Kakariko Village. If you planted the Magic Bean at the valley behind the Carpenter's Son, then use it to reach the bridge leading to Hyrule Field more quickly. Otherwise, return to Hyrule Field via Kokiri Forest. Back in the Field, get on Epona and ride her to Kakariko Village in the northeast corner of the Field.

Once inside the village, head for the Potion Shop near the north edge of town (it has a picture of a large boiling cauldron above it's door). Enter the shop (it must be daytime to work), and go through the passage on the left side of the store to reach the grotto behind the buildings. Jump down from the ledge as you come out of the door, and climb up the stairs on the opposite side of the grotto. Enter the building and show the Hag inside the Odd Mushroom. She will turn it into the Odd Potion.

If you fail to reach the Hag before the time limit runs out, then return to the Carpenter's Son to get another Odd Mushroom.

## Part IV: The Odd Potion

Return to the Carpenter's Son in the Lost Woods. Remember, he is to the left as you enter the Lost Woods from the entrance behind Mido's House in Kokiri Forest. When you reach the clearing, however, the Carpenter's Son is gone, and is replaced by a Kokiri Girl. You arrived too late to save him from the curse. Give the Kokiri Girl the Odd Potion, and she'll give you the Poacher's Saw.

## Part V: The Poacher's Saw

Return to Hyrule Field, and head for Gerudo Valley on the west side of Hyrule Field (nine o'clock on the clock face). Ride Epona up the log bridge, and charge straight at the broken bridge using Epona at maximum speed to leap over it. Alternatively, you can also use the Longshot, if you have progressed that far in the game.

Speak with the Carpenter on the other side of the bridge, standing outside of the tent, and then show him the Poacher's Saw. He'll recognize it as his own, and give you the Broken Goron's Sword.

## Part VI: The Broken Goron's Sword

There is only one craftsman in all of Hyrule who can repair this once mighty weapon: The Biggoron of Death Mountain. Head for Kakariko Village and then go up Death Mountain Trail. If you planted a Magic Bean at the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern, then use the Magic Leaf to ride to the halfway point of Death Mountain. If you didn't plant the Magic Bean, then you'll have to take the long way.

Once you're at the peak, arouse Biggoron's attention by standing on the right side of the cliff, and then show him the Broken Goron's Sword. He'll admit that he'd love to repair the Sword, but he can't because the last eruption blinded him. You'll have to get some medicinal eyedrops from the King Zora first.

## Part VII: The Prescription

Return to Hyrule Field, and go to Zora's River (three o'clock on the clock face). If you planted the Magic Bean near the start of the River, then ride it to the end. Enter Zora's Domain, and climb to the top of the cavern to reach the King Zora. If you haven't done the Ice Cavern yet, then King Zora will still be encased in red ice. But you can still unfreeze him if you're doing the entire quest string as soon as you have obtained Epona. If you have already unfrozen the King Zora, then give him the Prescription and skip to the next step.

You have two options to unfreeze King Zora: you can either go to Kakariko Village and purchase a Blue Flame from the Potion Shop there (for a hefty 300 rupee price tag), or you can head for the Ice Cavern ahead of schedule and get a Blue Flame for free. The Ice Cavern is a little ahead of you chronologically, but the mini-dungeon is incredibly easy, so don't be afraid to enter it.

Go to Zora's Fountain using the entrance behind King Zora's throne, and enter the Ice Cavern by standing on Jabu Jabu's altar, and jumping along the frozen platforms in the pond until you reach the northern edge of the Fountain. Enter the Ice Cavern, and run down the passage to the first room. Kill the three Freezzard's in the room using sword strikes or Din's Fire while dodging the Blade Trap. Enter the door that opens.

Run down the hall to the next room, which contains a large blade made of ice that rotates steadily. Gather all of the Silver Rupees in the room, and enter the door that opens. Run to the end of this passage, and in the next room run along the different platforms to the pillar of Blue Fire on the second level. Watch out for Ice Keese and Freezzards along the way. Capture the Blue Fire in a bottle, and return to the King Zora. Use the bottle of Blue Fire while standing next to the King to unfreeze him. Show him the Prescription, and he'll give you the ingredients needed. But you'll have to take them elsewhere to get the Eyedrops made.

## Part VIII: The Eyeball Frog Time Limit: 3:00

The Eyeball Frog must be delivered to the scientist in the Observatory at Lake Hylia in less then three minutes. This would be no problem with the Lake Hylia shortcut in Zora's Domain... except that the entrance is blocked as Adult Link. Curses!

Quickly run back out to Zora's River, and ride the river back to Hyrule Field. Hop aboard Epona and hightail it to Lake Hylia, which is in the southwest corner of the Field. Use Epona to hop over the fences and save time wasted trying to climb over them on foot. Ride Epona right into the Lake Hylia area and right to the doorstep of the Observatory. Step inside and show the Scientist the Eyeball Frog, and after mistaking them for his dinner, he'll make you the Eyedrops.

If you run out of time, then speak with King Zora again to get another Eyeball Frog.

## Part IX: Biggoron's Eyedrops Time Limit: 4:00

You've now got to run clear across Hyrule and climb Death Mountain in less then four minutes. No problem, right? With Epona and the Magic Leaf out front of Dodongo's Cavern, you should make it with plenty of time. Without the Magic Leaf, you'll be pushing it, and without Epona, you don't stand a chance.

Step outside the Observatory and get back on Epona. Ride her back to Hyrule Field, and jump back over the fences. Go to Kakariko Village in the northeast corner of the zone. Get off Epona and enter the Village, then go to Death Mountain Trail in the north of the Village. If you planted the Magic Beans as a child, then ride the Magic Leaf at the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern to the halfway point of the mountain, then climb the rest of the way. Otherwise, you'll have to take the long way up, and you'll be pushing the clock if you do. Give Biggoron the Eyedrops.

## Part X: The Claim Check

Now that he can see again, the Biggoron will repair the sword. Free of charge. What a guy. Play the Sun's Song six times to force three days to pass, then show Biggoron your Claim Check. He'll give you the Biggoron Sword for all your trouble. The Biggoron Sword deals twice the damage that the Master Sword does, but is so large that you can't handle a Shield while using it.
