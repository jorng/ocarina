# Obtaining Epona

Obtaining Epona is a relatively simple task once you know how to do it, but actually getting to the point where you can unlock her has been known to confuse certain players. Given that the entire game can be beaten, and beaten easily, without obtaining Epona, it's not unusual for younger or casual players to completely miss their opportunity without realizing it.

In order to ride Epona, and later take her from the Ingo-controlled Lon Lon Ranch, you must first learn Epona's Song from Malon as Young Link. This can be done at any time after meeting Zelda and learning Zelda's Lullaby. Head for Lon Lon Ranch during the daytime, and head for the middle of the pasture. Speak with Malon until she mentions her mother, then pull out your Ocarina (Fairy Ocarina, Ocarina of Time, it doesn't matter which). Malon will then teach you Epona's Song, which tames Epona and also makes any Cow in the game give you a free bottle of Lon Lon Milk.

Fast forward to Adult Link. This next step can be done at any time after becoming Adult Link, and can even be the very first thing you do once you arrive. Run to the pasture in the rear of the ranch, and speak with Ingo. After a lengthy speech about how great Ganondorf is, Ingo will offer to let you ride a horse for ten rupees. Do so, and you will be allowed into the pasture. Ignore the horse that Ingo offers you, and play Epona's Song. Epona will appear and run towards you. This is where it gets tricky; you can't take Epona just yet. Ride out your time in the pasture, then speak with Ingo again. Agree to ride again, and this time speak to Ingo while riding Epona and he will challenge you to a race for fifty rupees.

At this point, you and Ingo will both appear on the track around the pasture riding your horses. In the first race against Ingo, he goes fairly slowly, and takes the corners very wide. Stay close behind him until he gets near a corner, then quickly hug the inside rail and burn two or three carrots to shoot in front of him. At this point, just carefully steer yourself to stay directly in front Ingo, preventing him from getting in front of you. You don't even have to use carrots. If he gets in front of you, wait for Ingo to take the next wide corner and shoot in front of him again.

After you win the first race, Ingo will have a meltdown and frantically bet Epona on a rematch. Agree. This time, Ingo will cheat and leave the starting gate a second before the clock goes off. Even though he now goes slightly faster and cheats at the start, the race is still identical, and he still takes turns incredibly wide. Wait for the first turn in the track, and burn two or three carrots to shoot in front of him while he takes the wide corner. Now, it's a simple matter of staying in front of him and blocking his progress forward. The occasional use of a carrot may be necessary.

After the race, Ingo will honor his bet and give you Epona. But he also will close the gate to the Ranch and refuse to let you leave. You'll have to jump the gate using Epona. Return to the track going around the pasture, and run around it in a counter-clockwise direction (the opposite direction you go in the race). Use one carrot, then wait for it to regenerate, then use it again, to keep your speed up. When you reach the last turn in the course and can see the gate directly in front of you, burn all six of your carrots at once and run straight at the gate. If you aim yourself properly you'll soar right over the gate and Epona will now be yours to use in Hyrule Field, Lake Hylia, Gerudo Valley and Lon Lon Ranch. Simply play Epona's Song to make her appear.
