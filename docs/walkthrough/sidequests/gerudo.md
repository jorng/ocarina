# The Gerudo Training Ground

The Gerudo Training Ground is a series of obstacle courses and timed challenges, built in a rough square around a central "Treasure Room."  This Treasure Room contains, among other useless trinkets, the Ice Arrows. These arrows are absolutely worthless in progressing the game forward, but are a fun item to have and use nonetheless.

In this walkthrough for the Gerudo Training Ground, instructions are given on how to complete each room, though no specific order is given on when to complete each room. Traditionally the rooms are completed clockwise from the entrance hall, and the order of the rooms in this guide reflects this. You can tackle them in any order you wish, however. You need a minimum of seven keys to reach the Ice Arrows, and once you have acquired this number of keys the dungeon is essentially "finished" and you can go about your business elsewhere. The remaining chests in the Treasure Room, especially those going to the right from the main entrance, contains useless junk which isn't really worth bothering with.

The dungeon cannot be completed "fully" without the Silver Gauntlets from the Young Link portion of the Spirit Temple. However, the Ice Arrows can be obtained without the Silver Gauntlets. Go left through the first door in the treasure room from it's main entrance, and you will reach the Ice Arrows before you run out of keys. Remember, you need a minimum of seven keys to reach the Ice Arrows. Since there is a hidden key in the Treasure Room itself on the way to the Ice Arrows, once you have six keys then you can head for the Treasure Room to get your reward and leave the dungeon.

The Gerudo Training Ground is only available after Adult Link rescues the captured Carpenters in Gerudo Fortress and becomes an honorary Gerudo Thief. For instructions on how to accomplish this, see the appropriate Subchapter, "Return to Gerudo Valley."  The entrance to the Training Ground is on the southeastern edge of the Gerudo Fortress. Speak with the Gerudo Lieutenant standing near the steel grating, pay the entrance fee, and she will let you in.

## Entrance

Run forward up the stairs as you enter the Training Ground. At the top of the stairs, turn around and look up above the door frame to see a golden eye switch. Shoot the eye switch with an arrow, and a chest will appear in between two of the pillars in the room. Open it to get a bundle of arrows. Another chest in between the pillars opposite contains a Blue Rupee.

There are three doors in this room. The one directly opposite the entrance leads to the Treasure Chamber, which should be your last destination. The doors to the left and right of the Treasure Chamber go to the Gerudo Training Ground. The entire Training Ground loops around, connecting back to this room. You can go left or right. This guide starts on the left side. If you choose to go right first, then skip to the last heading of this subchapter, and follow the guide backwards.

## Sand Stalfos Room

    `1:00`
??? tip "Hint"
    Defeat all the enemies in a LIMITED TIME!
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Key

This room contains a sand pit and a pile of rocks. Run past the Blade Trap and into the room, and a pair of Stalfos will appear. Defeat them in the usual fashion, and in under 1:00, and a chest containing this room's Small Key will appear. Keep moving at all times; you will slowly sink into the sand, making it harder to move, if you don't stay moving. Go through the door to the right of the treasure chest containing the Key, and into the next room.

## Silver Rupee/Rolling Boulder Room
!!! abstract "Required Items"
    - Hookshot
!!! warning "Time Limit"
    1:30
??? tip "Hint"
    Gather the JEWELS OF WHITE, while avoiding traps and danger!

This room is made of three hallways, which has a number of Silver Rupees scattered around it. The outer halls contain rolling boulders which will try to knock you into cliffs near the bottom half of the room. The small passages connecting the halls contain Wall Masters. Remember, if you enter First Person Mode, then the Wall Masters will disappear temporarily.

Look up as you enter the room, and you will see a Longshot target on the ceiling. Pull yourself up to it with the Longshot (the Hookshot if you still haven't done the Water Temple). You may have to run down the hall a bit and then turn around before you can get a good shot off.

Run down the hall, and take the first passage on the left (ignore the passages on the right). In this passage, wait for a boulder to pass by in the hall in front of you, then quickly run left around the corner. Grab the Silver Rupee near the cliff edge before a boulder comes along and knocks you off the cliff. Turn around and run up the cliff, all the way to the top. Grab the Silver Rupee in the alcove here. Turn around, head back down the hill and take the second left. At the top of the hill, look to the right and off the cliff to see another Silver Rupee. Jump out and grab it.

At the bottom of the cliff, look to the left to see a ramp leading up. Run up the ramp, and take a right at the top. Run down the hill (watching for rolling boulders), and take a right at the bottom of the hill into the next passage. Grab the Silver Rupee here, but watch out for the sheet of flame that will erupt just behind the Silver Rupee. This Silver Rupee will unseal the door at the back of the room.

Turn around and run back up the hill, all the way to the last passage on the left. At the top of the ramp, look to the right and on the ceiling to see a Longshot target. Pull yourself up to it with the Hookshot/Longshot, and over another curtain of flame. Go through the door here.

    - Small Key

Step into the room, and a Wolfos will appear. Use the Backflip to Jump Attack maneuver to defeat it quickly, and a second Wolfos will appear. Defeat it, and run deeper into the room, where a White Wolfos will appear. These Wolfos are larger, but are still identical to Gray Wolfos in terms of strategy. Another White Wolfos will appear in the corner of the room if you pass near it. Once all four Wolfos are dead, a chest will appear which contains a bundle of arrows.

Against the far wall, there is the outline of a doorway which is blocked by a blue stone block. If you have the Silver Gauntlets, then you can push it forward to find a door to a small room. Enter this door to find a small room which houses three Like-Likes. Kill them all, and two chests will appear. Use the Lens of Truth and look in one of the small pits in the room to find an invisible chest, which contains a Small Key. Open the chest, then return to the previous room.

Destroy the False Door against the wall using Bombs or the Megaton Hammer, then look on the wall above it with the Lens of Truth to see an invisible passage. Pull yourself up to the Longshot Target with the Hookshot/Longshot. If you step on the switch inside this hallway, then the door that you came through will unseal itself. Go through the door at the end of the hall.

## Totem Room
!!! abstract "Required Items"
    - Bow & Arrow
??? tip "Hint"
    Blind the EYES OF THE STATUE!
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Keys (x2)

When you enter the room, you will be on a high ledge. Run along the ledge to the right, where there is a door. Go through it and open the chest inside to get a Small Key, then return to the Totem Room.

Jump off the ledge, landing on a rotating platform on the lower level. Pull your Bow and fire arrows into the eyes of the statue in the middle of the room. Let the rotating platform carry you into the range of the next eye, don't move yourself. You'll know you've hit the eyes properly if the statue makes a groaning noise and the eye turns red. The eyes will reset after a short time, so you have to hit them all in one pass.

After all of the eyes are pierced with arrows, then a chest will fall down in front of the statue, and the door on the lower level will unlock. Pull yourself over to the chest with the Longshot (just jump if you don't have the Longshot), and then open the chest to get a Small Key. Jump into the lava to warp back to the beginning of the room if you don't have the Longshot.

Go through the door on the lower level of the room once you're done. The door on the upper level leads to one of the side entrances of the Treasure Room.

## Flaming Enemy Room

??? tip "Hint"
    Find a secret passage in this room!
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Key

Run into the room and start massacring all of the numerous Fire Slugs and Fire Keese who run around here. Once all of them are dead, a door will unseal itself and a chest will appear. Open the chest to get another bundle of arrows.

Using the Megaton Hammer, smash all of the statues around the perimeter of the room. The two statues to the right of the chest of arrows hide a switch and a golden eye. Shoot the eye with an arrow, and the other door in the room will unseal itself. Step onto the switch, and the pillar of flames guarding the chest in the center of the room will deactivate. Open it to get a Small Key. Go through the door to the left of the chest (it's the door which isn't at the end of a hallway).

## The Sea of Fire
!!! abstract "Required Items"
    - Hookshot
    - Song of Time
??? tip "Hint"
    Cross the Sea of Fire!
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Key

Another Silver Rupee puzzle. If you fall in this room at any time, you will have to get all of the Silver Rupees over again.

Run forward as you enter, and turn around and look above the doorway when you reach the end of the cliff. Pull yourself up to the Longshot target here with the Hookshot/Longshot to get the first Silver Rupee.

Walk to the edge of the cliff, and on the left you will see a platform with another Silver Rupee on it. Jump down to it. To the right is another platform. Jump out to it. Navi will flutter out into an empty space in the middle of the room; play the Song of Time here to make two Blocks of Time appear (if only one appears, you didn't get close enough - but one is enough). Climb up onto the Blocks of Time, and from there jump to the high ledge against the right wall. Take the Small Key that lies up here. The doorway leads to one of the Treasure Chamber side entrances; ignore it.

Jump back out to the lower Block of Time, and from there jump to the left to get another Silver Rupee. Jump back to the Block of Time, and then jump out to the next platform with a Silver Rupee on it. Look to the right here to see another platform, which has a switch on it. This switch deactivates the pillar of flames on the other side of the room, letting you get the last Silver Rupee. To reach it, jump back to the Blocks of Time, and jump up to the upper ledge. From there, jump to the platform containing the Silver Rupee before the pillar of flames returns.

Once you have all five Silver Rupees, the door on the left side of the room will unseal. The pillar of flames will reactivate after you get the Silver Rupee, knocking you off the ledge. But the door will remain unsealed. Go through that door.

## Underwater Rupee Room
!!! abstract "Required Items"
    - Iron Boots
    - Song of Time
    - Hookshot
??? tip "Hint"
    Gather the UNDERWATER GEMS!
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Key

Run into the middle of the room, and play the Song of Time to make the Blocks of Time in the floor vanish. Equip the Iron Boots and the Zora Tunic, and then sink into the pool of water beneath the Blocks of Time.

Defeat all of the Shell Blades at the bottom of the pool with the Hookshot, and watch out for the Blade Trap. You have two choices on gathering the Silver Rupees in the room: one, you can try to use the Longshot targets in the room to pull yourself into the rupees, or you can alternate between the Iron Boots and the Kokiri Boots to get them. I prefer the latter method, even though the pool's winding current makes this slightly tricky.

Once you have all five Silver Rupees, a chest will appear back above the pool of water. Climb out of the pool and open the chest to get a Small Key. Change back to the Kokiri Boots and whichever Tunic you like, and return to the Sea of Fire.

### The Sea of Fire

From the door to the Underwater Rupee Room, head to the left side of the Sea of Fire and go through the door there.

## Dinolfos Room
!!! abstract "Required Items"
    - Bombs
!!! warning "Time Limit"
    `1:30`
??? tip "Hint"
    Defeat all the enemies in a LIMITED TIME!
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Key

In this room, you will face a powered-up version of the Lizalfos, the Dinolfos. Treat them like regular Lizalfos, just be wary of their increased attack ability.

Blow up the Beamos statue with a Bomb or Bombchus, and then kill the Dinofols in the room. Watch out in the perimeter of the room; there are curtains of flame that will erupt and damage you if you're not careful. Once both of the Dinolfos and the Beamos are dead, then a chest containing a Small Key will appear. Take the Small Key, and then go through the door to the left of the Dinolfos Room to return to the entrance.

### Entrance

Go through the door across from the entrance and into the Treasure Room.

## Treasure Room
!!! example "New Dungeon Items"
    - Small Key

This room contains nine locked doors - which might seem problematic, since you only have eight keys (seven if you tried this dungeon before you got the Silver Gauntlets). Luckily, the ninth key is hidden in the room itself.

If you are doing this dungeon without the Silver Gauntlets, then go left first. In the first room on the left, use the Lens of Truth and look on the ceiling above to find a hidden passage. Use the wire wall to the left of the door to climb up into it (if you don't have the Lens of Truth either, then just keep climbing into the ceiling until you pass through the ceiling). At the top, you'll find a chest which contains Key #8/#9. The secret passage into the Treasure Chamber from the Sea of Flames leads to the right side of the Treasure Room, so don't get any bright ideas about shortcutting to the Ice Arrows.

The Treasure Room contains numerous chests, which appear as follows:

- **Right from the entrance**
    - Bombchus
    - Bundle of Arrows

- **Left from the entrance**
    - Purple Rupee
    - Red Rupee
    - Bundle of Arrows
    - Ice Arrows

Once you have the Ice Arrows, then you can just leave (you'll have to walk out – warp songs don't work in here). The other items in the treasure room are nothing to get excited about. If you screw up and go wrong the way at the start, you'll run out of keys. You'll have to return to the Training Ground with the Silver Gauntlets to get the last of the dungeon's nine keys, letting you access the Ice Arrows.
