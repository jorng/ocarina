This is the complete guide to _**The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**_. It covers the entire game, beginning to end, room for room, in high detail. All Gold Skulltula Tokens and Pieces of Heart are pointed out, and strategies are given for fighting the major enemies or maneuvering through the dungeons and overworld. If you're looking for a 100% completion rating, then this is the Walkthrough you're looking for.

!!! note "A Note on Organization"
    Each part of the walkthrough is divided into areas for ease of use. At the beginning of each area's section, if there are new songs, items or upgrades to be found, then it will be pointed out. New areas are generally separated by a "fade out" or "cut" of the in-game camera.

!!! note "A Note on the Passage of Time"
    If you need to be in an area at a certain time of day, then it will be specified in that area's heading in the guide. If it doesn't matter what time of day it is, then there will be no time stamp on the heading.
