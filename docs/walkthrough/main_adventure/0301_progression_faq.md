# Main Adventure Progression FAQ

## Introduction

The chapters in this guide's walkthrough follows the "preferred progression" for the game, and is written in such a way that it assumes that you have items that are covered in previous chapters, and do not have items that appear in future chapters. However, there are multiple paths which can be taken through the game once you finish the game's first three dungeons and become Adult Link. More advanced players may want to add variety to the game by completing Adult Link's adventures in different orders. That's what this chapter is for; it contains the different progressions you can choose to make it through the game.

## Step I

The game's beginning, and first three dungeons, are always the same, and when
you first reach adulthood, you MUST obtain the Hookshot before you can do
anything else. Once you have Epona, you can complete the Biggoron Sword
Sidequest at ANY time. Therefore, the first part of ANY game progression
always follows this chapter order:

- Kokiri Forest
- Dungeon I: Inside the Deku Tree
- Hyrule Castle
- Lon Lon Ranch and the Lost Woods
- Kakariko Village
- Death Mountain
- Dungeon II: Dodongo's Cavern
- Return to Death Mountain and Hyrule Castle
- Zora River, Zora's Domain, Lake Hylia and Gerudo Valley
- Dungeon III: Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly
    - Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (optional)
- Finishing Up Childhood
- Return to Lon Lon Ranch and Kakariko Village
    - Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest (optional)

## Step II

However, from there you have some flexibility. The Fire Temple and Ice Cavern can both be completed without the Fairy Bow from the Forest Temple, just as the Ice Cavern and Forest Temple can be completed without the Megaton Hammer from the Fire Temple, and the Fire Temple and Forest Temple can be completed without the Iron Boots from the Ice Cavern. And if you're done with the Ice Cavern and the Forest Temple, then you can proceed to the Water Temple before finishing the Fire Temple. Additionally, once you finish the Forest Temple and have the Fairy Bow, and once you have Epona, then the Gerudo Fortress CAN be completed at ANY time (though this guide will wait until you HAVE to do it). Also, once you have completed the Forest Temple, you can return to your childhood at any time, at which point The Bottom of the Well also becomes available. Lastly, the Big Poe Hunting sidequest can be completed at any time after obtaining Epona and getting the Fairy Bow. Did you get all that? So, the next "phase" of the game can take any one of these different progressions:

### Progression One

- Return to Kokiri Forest and the Lost Woods
- Dungeon IV: The Forest Temple
    - Return to Gerudo Valley (optional)
    - Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (optional)
    - Big Poe Hunting (optional)
- Return to Death Mountain and Death Mountain Crater

## Step III

Once you have finished any one of these five progressions, then you can go to either the Shadow Temple or the Spirit Temple. Before the Shadow Temple can be completed, however, then the Bottom of the Well Mini-Dungeon MUST be completed. And before the Spirit Temple can even be attempted, BOTH the Bottom of the Well and the Gerudo Fortress must be completed. You can also do the first half of the Spirit Temple, then run off to do the Shadow Temple, then do the second half of the Spirit Temple, if you choose. Therefore, the progression can follow any of these patterns:

### Progression One

- Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)

_After The Well..._

- Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple
- Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
- Crossing the Haunted Wasteland

- Spirit Temple Interlude
- Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)
