## Death Mountain Trail

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS021]

Go to the right and drop off the cliff. Kill the Tektites, then look for the oddly-shaped and oddly-colored bit of wall. Use a Bomb to blast open the wall, then use the Slingshot to kill the Gold Skulltula on the inside. The wall is climbable; climb up it to grab the Token.

Head back towards Dodongo's Cavern, and begin climbing up the Trail back towards Goron City. Kill any Tektites you may come across along the way. Turn right at the Red Flag, and keep heading for Goron City. You'll find another odd part of wall identical to the one that hid the Gold Skulltula. Blow it open if you like, but don't open the chest inside unless you need rupees - it contains a 50 rupee piece. Head down into Goron City.

## Goron City

Go to the left from the entrance until you reach a barrier of boulders. Use a bomb to blow open a path, and go through the tunnel behind and to the left of the boulders.

You'll come to a room overflowing with boulders. The brown ones can be blown up with bombs; the silver ones cannot. Destroy the brown rock to your right as you enter the "rock maze," then the brown rock behind it. Go through the gap you have created, and destroy the brown rock on the left. Go through the new gap, and take a right. Destroy the brown stone directly in front of you, and you will reach the end of the "maze."

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS022]

The chests contains two more fifty rupee pieces - save them for later if your Adult's Wallet is maxed. Roll into the crate here to destroy it, and kill the Gold Skulltula that appears. Take it's token, and return to the main part of Goron City. You now have 20 Skulltula Tokens, enough for the second reward from the House of Skulltula in Kakariko Village. We'll get to it in a few minutes.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :material-sack:{.bag-brown} Bomb Bag x30

Drop down to the third level of the city (the level directly beneath the top floor), where there is a Biggoron rolling around the level in a giant loop. You can stop him by placing a bomb in his path so that it explodes just as he passes over it. If you do this while he is passing through the tunnel in the northern part of the third floor, then he will give you the Bomb Bag x30 as a reward for your daring.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP09]

Once you have the Big Bomb Bag, drop down to the second level of Goron City (the level directly below the floor with the Rolling Biggoron). If you still haven't lit all of the torches on the bottom floor using the flame from Darunia's room, then do it now. This will cause the giant pot to begin rotating around the room. From the second level, you can throw bombs into the giant pot. If you successfully land a bomb inside the pot, then it will begin to spin rapidly, finally coming to a stop. If it stops on the side with the happy face, then you will get a Piece of Heart.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, climb back up to the second level of Goron City and use the secret passage to go to the Lost Woods.

## Lost Woods

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    Deku Nut Upgrade x30

Go left as you come out of the Goron City tunnel, and left again at the pool in the next area. Go straight at the next crossroads, and then left. Use a Bomb to blow up the boulder in the corner of this crossroads. Drop down the pit, and defeat both of the Business Scrubs inside with your Slingshot. One of them will increase the number of Deku Nuts you can carry for forty rupees. Accept the deal, then return to Goron City.

## Goron City

Climb to the top level of Goron City and return to Death Mountain Trail.

## Death Mountain Trail

Return to the Red Flag, on the right side of the road leading down from Goron City. Begin climbing the steeper part of the trail, on the left side of the flag post as you face Goron City. After a short climb up a steep slope, you come to a series of ledges with numerous boulders on it. Use bombs to destroy each of these boulders, and climb up the series of ledges. You will have to throw a bomb at one of the boulders to destroy it, so remember to hold it until just before it is ready to explode. The last boulder at the top of the ledges hides a pit, which contains, among other things, a Cow which you can use to replenish your supply of Milk (play Epona's Song).

Keep heading north, further up the Trail. After a short distance, the volcano will begin erupting, spewing lava down onto you. When you see the shadow beneath you, hide under the Hylian Shield with R to absorb the damage. Once you reach the cliff face, the eruptions will stop.

Once you are at the cliff face, use your Slingshot to kill the Skulltula, then climb up the wall to the first ledge. Shoot down another Skulltulla with your Slingshot, then climb up to the second ledge. On the second ledge, shoot down another Skulltula, then climb up to the highest peak of the mountain.

Kaepora Gaebora waits for you here. DO NOT SPEAK TO HIM. If you do, he'll give you a ride back down the mountain to Kakariko Village, which you don't want to do just yet. Bomb the oddly-colored wall to the left of KG, and enter the cave.

## Death Mountain Trail - Great Fairy's Fountain

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    - Magic Meter x1
    - Super Spin Attack

Run forward to the fountain, and stand on the Triforce emblem. Play Zelda's Lullaby to make the Dominatrix er, uh... Great Fairy appear. She will teach you the Super Spin Attack, which adds extra damage and range to your basic Spin Attack. She'll also grant you a Magic Meter. Leave the Fountain to return to Death Mountain Trail.

## Death Mountain Trail

Don't speak with Kaepora Gaebora just yet. We've got one more Gold Skulltula token to grab while we're up here. Enter the cave face to the right of KG.

## Death Mountain Crater

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS023]

Young Link can't handle the intense flames of Death Mountain Crater. You'll have to return when Link is older, wiser, and has some sexy new clothes before you can do much here. For the moment, smash both of the crates to your left as soon as you enter to find a Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token, then go back out to the Trail.

## Death Mountain Trail

Speak with Kaepora Gaebora, who will give you a lift down the mountain to Kakariko Village.

## Kakariko Village

You're done on Death Mountain for a little while, so if you like you can switch back to your Deku Shield now.

Kaepora Gaebora not only brought you back to Kakariko Village... he even dropped you on top of Impa's House! What a guy! If you didn't get the Piece of Heart from inside of Impa's House, then get it now by dropping down from the roof onto the balcony above the Cucco Pasture. If you miss it, then play the Sun's Song and you'll warp back to the top of the roof.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, or if you already had it from your first visit to Kakariko, then drop down off the roof, and enter the House of Skulltula, the single-story building directly across from Impa's House.

## House of Skulltula

!!! example inline end "New Quest Item"
    Stone of Agony

Go to the left side of the room, where a recently-decursed man will give you the Stone of Agony. The Stone works in conjunction with the Rumble Pak, and shakes when you go near hidden entrances that need to be bombed open. Sure, this is only useful for finding only a handful of Gold  Skulltulas, but hey... it's still kind of cool. Head back outside.

## Kakariko Village

Leave through the west end of the village to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

Before we continue on with our journey, we have a few errands to run in Hyrule Castle. Head west from Kakariko Village to Hyrule Castle. If it is nighttime, play the Sun's Song to open the gates. Enter Hyrule Castle, and go through the Market to the Garden.

## Hyrule Castle - Garden

Climb the ivy on the right to the cliff above the gate. Run over to the marble gate, and drop down on the other side. Run over to the dead end (it's marked with a sign which reads "Dead End"). Bomb the boulder to reveal a small tunnel. Crawl through the tunnel to find another Great Fairy's Fountain.

## Hyrule Castle - Great Fairy's Fountain

!!! tip inline end "New Quest Item"
    Din's Fire

Run to the Fountain, and stand on the Triforce Emblem. Play Zelda's Lullaby on the Ocarina to make another Dominatrix appear. She'll give you Din's Fire, an area of effect spell which burns all enemies in the room (and can also light large numbers of braziers at the same time). Return through the cave mouth.

## Hyrule Castle - Garden

Allow one of the guards to spot you, and you will be thrown back out to the gate. Return to Hyrule Castle Market.

## Hyrule Castle - Market

One of the shops in the Market which was closed on your last visit, is now open. Go to the left side of the Market, and enter the building with the large poster, whose door is at the foot of the long stairset.

    :rat: Bombchus

This minigame has no less then three new things to win (Piece of Heart, Bomb Bag and Bombchus), and isn't cheap to play. You may have to return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse or do the Drawbridge Rupee Trick multiple times before you finally get all three rewards. It isn't imperative that you get the Bombchus, but you'll probably end up winning them trying to get the Bomb Bag and the Piece of Heart anyway. Pay the clerk 30 rupees to play the game.

The object of Bombchu Bowling is to send the Bombchu (a mobile bomb) into the hole on the opposite end of the course. The course has three different goals to obtain, each one becoming progressively more difficult. Completing all three goals successfully will win you whatever prize the clerk showed you at the start.

For the first goal, the target is always in the center of the field. Simply stand in the exact middle of the field (slightly to the right of the center arrow is the exact middle of the field) and time it so your Bombchu avoids the Blade Trap. The next level of the field can be on the top, left, or right, and adds a small Cucco to dodge. The Cucco isn't as predictable as the Blade Trap in it's movements, but is so small it almost isn't an issue. The last goal is always in the exact center, and adds a Fat Cucco who always stands roughly in the center of the field (but you can sneak a Bombchu by it if you're careful).

When you're playing Bombchu Bowling, always position yourself in the center of the field. The one exception is when the target appears on the right in the second round; you have to minorly adjust your position to the left or right, otherwise it's impossible to angle yourself properly for the Bombchu to enter the target. If the hole appears on the left side of the field, then adjust your angle so that the Bombchu goes along the floor, then the wall, then into the hole. For holes in the center or top of the playing field, simply wait until all of the targets are in the right position, and send a Bombchu straight down the middle. Absolutely never play anywhere except in the exact center of the field (again, except for when the target appears on the right in the second round). Bombchu Bowling is, ultimately, more a game of patience and timing then luck.

Once you have at least the Piece of Heart and the Bomb Bag, you can leave. As I already said, the Bombchus are entirely optional.

## Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

If you're doing the Happy Mask Trading Sequence, then head for the Happy Mask Shop. If you're not going to do it, then head for Zora's River, which is in Hyrule Field at the 2:00 position, and skip down to the heading marked Zora's River.

Pay the 20 rupees for the Skull Mask, then borrow the Spooky Mask. Return to Kakariko Village and go to the Graveyard.

## Kakariko Graveyard (daytime)

If it's nighttime, play the Sun's Song to change it to Day. Speak with Dampe's Fanboy (the little kid who walks around the graves during the day) while wearing the Spooky Mask, and he'll buy it from you for 30 rupees. Now, let's return to Hyrule Castle Market and get the last Happy Mask. Return to the Happy Mask Shop in Hyrule Castle Market.
