## Hyrule Field

Point yourself south, and head for the large structure whose opening is just visible. Run straight through to the opening to enter Lon Lon Ranch. Make sure it is daytime before you enter.

## Lon Lon Ranch (daytime)

Run forward a short ways, then immediately enter the first door on your left that you reach.

## Lon Lon Ranch - Ranch House (daytime)
!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :jar: Bottle #1

In this building, Talon will play a game with you. He will throw three "special" cuccos into the pack of regular cuccos, and if you can find all three of the special cuccos before the time runs out, then he'll reward you with a Bottle, filled with Lon Lon Milk. You can do it "legit" by actually searching for the cuccos yourself (they are indistinguishable from the others, only Talon can tell the difference). Or you can cheat by throwing all of the cuccos into the corner, behind the long counter that Talon sits on. "Select" the Cuccos by picking them up. Whichever way you choose, complete the minigame to receive your first Bottle, then go back outside.

## Lon Lon Ranch (daytime)
!!! info inline end "New Song"
    :material-music: Epona's Song

From the door, run to Link's left, through the arch to enter a large field. Enter the pasture through the gate to the right, and talk to Malon in the center. Malon will thank you for waking up her father, then introduce you to the pony Epona. Epona will run away from you (she doesn't like strangers). Speak with Malon again until she mentions her mother, then whip out your Ocarina. Malon will then teach you Epona's Song. In addition to eventually letting you ride Epona later in the game, Epona's Song will also get you free Lon Lon Milk from ANY cow in the game. This way you can avoid Talon's absurd prices.

Leave the pasture, then go to the mill in the rear of the field (behind the pasture). Enter the door of the mill.

## Lon Lon Ranch - Mill (daytime)

In the corner of the room, there are a large number of milk crates. Push the crates around so that they form this pattern:

       _ _
     X|_|_|
     _ _|_|
    |_|_|_|

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP02]

The `X` marks where a new tunnel will have appeared. Crawl through the tunnel to find an empty nest, which houses a Piece of Heart. Take it, then crawl back through the tunnel, leave the Mill and return to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

Hang around Hyrule Field until it becomes nighttime, then reenter Lon Lon Ranch.

## Lon Lon Ranch (nighttime)

    Gold Skulltula Tokens <br />
    :material-shield-bug:{.gold-token} [GS006]
    :material-shield-bug:{.gold-token} [GS007]

Run through the arch that leads to the pasture, and roll into the tree just to the left of the arch. Kill the Gold Skulltula that falls down, and take it's token. Now, circle around to the back of the pasture, so that you are on the outer wall of the small awning. Kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token, but watch out for the Guay bird enemies. Return to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

Ignore the Stalchild enemies who appear here; we need to book it to Kokiri Forest. Head back to Kokiri Forest now, which is at the three o'clock position on your map. It's pretty much due east of Lon Lon Ranch. Make sure it's nighttime, then enter the hollowed out log, run across the Lost Woods Bridge and enter Kokiri Forest.

## Kokiri Forest (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-shield-bug:{.gold-token} [GS008]

Climb the hill to your right as you enter, and go around to the rear of the Know-It-All Brother's House (the large, squat tree house with the giant leaf coming out of it's top). Kill the Gold Skulltula back here, and grab the token by facing away from the token, holding down Z, and holding back and A to backflip into the token.

Climb down to Mido's House, and climb up to the cliff behind his house. Climb up the Ivy Wall, go around the corner of the cliff, and through the hollowed log to the Lost Woods.

## Lost Woods

In order to find Saria, we'll have to follow the sound of her music through the Lost Woods. Or you could just follow my directions thoroughly. Begin by going to the right, through the hollowed log.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :material-sack:{.bag-brown} Bullet Bag x50

Run forward to the edge of the cliff, and whip out your Slingshot. Shoot the drum hanging from the tree limb, and try to adjust your aim so that you hit the exact middle. You'll know you've done it right, as it will give you 100 points and make a small sound of victory when it works. Try to get the center of the Slingshot's "rubber band" aimed at approximately the center of the drum before you fire. Three successive shots to the exact center of the drum will cause a Deku Scrub to appear, who will reward you with the Bullet Bag x50, the largest Slingshot ammunition bag in the game.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP03]

Drop down the cliff to the small valley below, and go all the way to the right. Stand on the low trunk, and two Skullkids will appear. Take out your Ocarina, and play a lengthy memory game with them. Complete the entire game (three rounds, each becoming increasingly longer and harder) to earn another Piece of Heart. The Skullkids play each addition to the song twice; to learn the new part the fastest, watch the first Skullkid play the song, then play along with the second one. This way, you're in good shape when it's your turn to play the tune.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, turn around and climb back up the ladder. Go through the hollowed log to the right of the ladder once you reach the top. On the other side, you will be ambushed by Kaepora Gaebora, with his most long- winded bit of advice yet. Tell him "No," you don't want to listen to the feathery wind bag repeat his advice again. If you're wondering, the stone arch here goes to Goron City, one of our next destinations. Unfortunately, as of yet, we can't use this shortcut as we aren't properly equipped. Go through the hollowed log tunnel that KG was standing on.

On the other side, there is a pool. This pool leads to Zora's Domain, but as with the Goron City shortcut we're not properly equipped to use it yet. Go left through another tunnel. Go straight from here through another tunnel, then hang a left through another tunnel, then go right at the next crossroads to enter the Sacred Forest Meadow.

## The Sacred Forest Meadow
!!! info inline end "New Song"
    :material-music: Saria's Song

Run forward a short ways, and you will immediately be ambushed by a Gray Wolfos, the weakest variety of Wolfos. Wolfos are a common enemy, especially later in the game, but luckily are very easily defeated. They like to defend against most basic attacks, but are vulnerable immediately after they attack. The easiest method to defeat the Gray Wolfos (or any Wolfos, for that matter) is to stand still, and wait for them to move in close. Just as they attack, perform a back flip (Back + A while Z-Targeted) to dodge their attack, then immediately after you land perform a Jump Attack (press A while Z-targeted). The Wolfos will briefly have his back turned to you, and the Jump Attack will kill it in one shot.

When the Gray Wolfos dies, the gate blocking the entrance to the Sacred Forest Meadow will disappear, letting you in. Turn to the right, then follow the path around the corner. Kill or run past the Deku Scrub (you must now attack the Deku Scrubs to kill it, instead of just standing on it's nest), and go around another corner. Kill or dodge another Deku Scrub, and run around another corner. Take a left down a grassy detour, then another left back onto the main road.

Jump into the pool of water at the end of the road, then jump back onto the road with the Deku Scrub right in front of you. Kill or dodge the Deku Scrub, and go around the corner. Take a left and go up the stairs. Run down the long corridor, killing/dodging two more Deku Scrubs, then run up the stairs. At the top, you will find Saria sitting in a small, overgrown courtyard. Saria will now teach you Saria's Song, which brings happiness to the depressed, and allows you to communicate telepathically with Saria at any time.

Head back down the stairs you came up, down the long corridor, and down the second flight of stairs. Climb the ladder directly in front of you, and jump along the cliffs to get out of Sacred Forest Meadow more quickly then how you came in. The pit in the middle of the upper cliffs area contains a Fairy Fountain if you need Life. Run back to the entrance to the Meadow and return to the Lost Woods.
