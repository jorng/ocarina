Jabu-Jabu's Belly is easily the game's strangest and most unorthodox dungeons, and contains some of the first truly "difficult" puzzles in the game (though it's nothing compared to the puzzles that appear in Master Quest). In the dungeon, players must try to activate an elevator in Jabu-Jabu's throat, which leads to the boss' chamber. This is easier said then done, however, as several areas of Jabu-Jabu's Belly are blocked by parasitic tentacles, which must be destroyed first. Players will loop constantly through old rooms in trying to clear the dungeon.

## Entrance

Run forward a few feet, and a pair of Octoroks will appear on the left and right. Kill them with your Slingshot, then use Deku Nuts to kill the Shaboms (the floating bubble enemies). Run to the north end of the room and shoot the large yellow bump on the ceiling with your Slingshot. The "door" at the end of the hall will unseal. Go through it.

## Elevator Room

There is a new, floating jellyfish-like enemy in this room called a "Biri." It's immune to all of your weapons at the moment, so for now we're just going to ignore any of them we come across. If a Biri gets too close, use a Deku Nut to stun it. You actually can then kill it with your sword once it's stunned, but it's far easier to just avoid them.

Run around the left side, following the platform, and enter the door on the other side.

## Pit Room

Take a few steps into the room, and you'll find Princess Ruto, safe and sound. But she won't be happy to see you, and runs away, falling through a pit in the floor. Follow her down through the same pit.

Speak with her when you land, and she'll accidentally let slip that she lost a sacred stone in Jabu-Jabu's belly. Speak with her again, and she'll agree to come with you, but only if you help her find her stone first. You now get the privilege of carrying Ruto around with you everywhere you go.

Pick Ruto up, then leave through the east door, which should be behind you as you land from the upper level.

## Water Room

Drop Ruto, and kill the Shaboms in the hallway with Deku Nuts. Pick Ruto up again, and run to the hall's end. Jump down into the pit, but be very careful that you don't step on the switch in the middle of the room. The water level will rise, and Ruto (who doesn't like water... go figure) will return to the Pit Room. Throw Ruto up onto the ledge on the north side of the room, then kill the enemies in the pit with you.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS030]

Use Deku Nuts to make the Stingers (the submerged enemies whose fins you can see) jump up, and kill them with the Slingshot. Once you have killed all of the Stingers, turn to the "ivy" covered wall to the west. Kill the Gold Skulltula on the wall with the Slingshot. Next, jump onto the switch, and the water level will rise. Climb onto the "ivy" on the west wall, and up into the alcove, grabbing the Token on the way.

Destroy the pots in the alcove to find a Fairy and some Seeds. Capture the fairy in an empty bottle if you have one, then jump down back into the pit. Step onto the switch again to make the water level rise, then get onto the northern ledge where you threw Ruto earlier.

Pick up Ruto, then run into the hall. Kill more Shaboms with Deku Nuts, then shoot the switch on the ceiling with your Slingshot (or you can even use Ruto to nail the switch if you're feeling sadistic. The door at the end of the hall will unlock. Go through it.

## Elevator Room

Wait for the elevator to come down. Kill the Octorok if you have to. Get on the elevator, and ride it to the top of the Pit Room while carrying Ruto. If you're wondering, the submerged tunnel leads to a Business Scrub who sells overpriced Deku Nuts.

Look to the right at the top of the elevator, and go through the door back to the Pit Room.

## Pit Room

Run straight across the room to the opposite door, avoiding Biri and the pits in the floor. If you fall down, you'll have to go back around through the Water Room and back up the Elevator Room. As you pass through the Pit Room, take note of the pit covered by the gigantic green tentacle. Once we get rid of that tentacle, we'll be dropping down that hole.

## Crawling Hallway

Just run past any enemies you encounter in this hallway. It's far easier to avoid them then to fight them. If you must, then Z-target them and use basic Sword techniques. Run to the right, and step onto the yellow switch while carrying Ruto. Normally, your weight alone wouldn't be enough, but with Ruto's help then the switch will activate. Go through the unlocked door in front of the switch.

## Stinger Room

!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :boomerang: Boomerang

You probably can't tell, but this room is crawling with Stingers. Use Deku Nuts or run in front of their paths to reveal them. Kill them with your Slingshot. Once they are all dead, a chest will appear. Open it to find the Boomerang, an important weapon for Young Link. This will help you to kill the Biris, as well as remove those troublesome tentacles that have been appearing throughout the dungeon. Most importantly, however, it lets you claim Skulltula Tokens from a range, finally giving you access to those troublesome Gold Skulltulas you may have seen lurking in high places.

Boomerang in hand, pick up Ruto and return through the door.

## Crawling Hallway

Run straight down the hallway to it's opposite end. You will see a blue switch in front of a door. Jump onto the switch while carrying Ruto, and it will press down. However, if you step off the switch then it will rise again. You'll have to leave Ruto behind on the switch, by stepping down on it, then pressing A to leave Ruto on it. Go through the door once you've jammed the button, leaving Ruto behind.

## Orange Tentacle Room


This room contains a very long parasitic tentacle. No, it's not a... nevermind. It's a tentacle. Z-Target it, and use your Boomerang to attack the narrow segment near the base of the tentacle. It will then retract into the wall. You need to strike that segment three more times with the boomerang. To do so, run forward until the Tentacle stretches and makes a swishing noise, meaning it is about to strike. Release the Boomerang at this exact moment while running backwards, and you will avoid damage and strike the tentacle. Repeat two more times to kill it. Killing the Orange Tentacle will remove all of the other orange tentacles blocking passage to other areas of the dungeon.

!!! example inline end ":fontawesome-solid-map:{.map-brown} Dungeon Map"

A chest will appear once the Tentacle dies, open it to find the Dungeon Map. Return to the Crawling Hallway.

## Crawling Hallway

Ruto will be waiting for you on the other side of the door. She'll give you a right ol' telling off for leaving her behind. Pick the royal pain up, then go to the left from the blue switch. This door is now unblocked. Go through it.

## Shabom Room

!!! example inline end ":compass: Compass"

This room requires you to kill a pack of Shaboms in forty seconds. Easy even using the Slingshot, but a piece of cake with Deku Nuts. Use both to defeat all of the Shaboms. A chest will appear upon their demise. Open it to find the Compass. Pick Ruto up and return to the Crawling Hallway.

## Crawling Hallway

Go down the hall, take a left, go straight, then left again. Go through the door.

## Blue Tentacle Room

This room contains another tentacle. The fight is identical to the fight against the Orange Tentacle. Hit it with the boomerang, run forward to make it strike at you, then hit it with the boomerang again while dodging the attack. Hit it four times to kill it. All of the Blue Tentacles around the dungeon will now disappear. Pick up Ruto and return to the Crawling Hallway.

## Crawling Hallway

Go right down the hall, then take another right. Go through the door at the end of the hall.

## Green Tentacle Room

In addition to a very large green tentacle, this room also has a number of Biri. The Biri are no problem now that you have a Boomerang, however. Eliminate the Biri first, then turn your attention to the Tentacle. Hit it with the boomerang, run forward to make it strike at you, then hit it with the boomerang again while dodging the attack. Hit it four times to kill it. All of the Green Tentacles around the dungeon will now disappear. Pick up Ruto and return to the Crawling Hallway.

## Crawling Hallway

Run straight across the hallway back to the Pit Room.

## Pit Room


If you'll remember, the last time you were in here I told you to note where a large tentacle was covering a pit. Now that we've gotten rid of all the tentacles in the dungeon, we are now free to drop down that pit. If you weren't paying attention the last time you were here, the pit is the one closest to the west wall, to the right as you come in from the Crawling Hallway. Drop down this pit.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens (2) :material-spider:{.gold-token} :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS031] [GS032]

When you land, set down Ruto and face the north. You will see not one, but two Gold Skulltulas on the wall. Kill them both with the Boomerang, then use the Boomerang again to claim their Tokens. When manually aiming the Boomerang, use Link's head as a targeting reticule. Once you have both of the Tokens, pick up Ruto and go through the door to the west.

### MINI BOSS - Bigocto

When you enter the room, Ruto will see her Stone sitting on a ledge. Throw her up onto the ledge so that she can claim it. However, the ledge will immediately rise up - it's actually an elevator! When the elevator comes back down, Ruto is gone. And a new friend has arrived.

The Bigocto is a really easy fight, it can just take some time to do it. His weakpoint is a large green "eye" on his backside. The Bigocto is vulnerable to the Boomerang - it stuns him and locks him in place. To gain access to Bigocto's backside, you must stun him with the Boomerang, then begin running around to his backside by circling around the large platform in the middle of the room. After he recovers from the stun, the Bigocto will begin running in a random direction. If he begins to run towards you, then you'll have to stun him again and start over. If he runs in the same direction as you, then keep circling until you reach his backside (it can take a while - try to hug as close to the inner wall as you can). Once you have reached his backside, stun him with the Boomerang, and use a Jump Attack to damage his green eye. Two Jump Attacks will defeat the Bigocto.

Another alternative is to simply let him run into you. He will then turn around, letting you stun him and attack him. This is less glamorous and sloppier, but works much more quickly and easily.

After the Bigocto is dead, step onto the middle platform and the elevator will rise. Ruto is still gone. You'll have to find her if you want that Spiritual Stone. Run south down the hall and through the door, killing any Biri who get in your way.

## Pink Thing Room

This room has two "Pink Things" in it. You'll have to run across them to reach the next door. Unfortunately, the only way to get across them is to stun them with the Boomerang. Stun the first one with the Boomerang, then jump out onto it. Then stun the second one, then jump to the door. Go through the door. If the Octorok gets in your way, kill it.

## Elevator Room

Run forward, and jump across to the platform on the opposite wall. The ledge will immediately lower, showing yourself to be right next door to the Dungeon's entrance. Note the blue switch in front of you as the ledge comes to a stop. Run around to the door by the Pit Room and grab one of the boxes, then step onto the blue button. The button will depress. Drop the box so that it sits on the button, forcing it to stay activated. Go through the door.

## Biri Room
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS033]

Kill all of the Biri around the room, then go around to the southeast side of the room. Kill the Gold Skulltula on the ivy wall, and climb up to take it's token. Climb all the way up the ivy wall to the platform at it's top. At the top, look to the right to see a switch. Z-Target it and use the Boomerang to hit it. The door in the north end of the room will unlock. Jump down and go through it.

## Bio-Electric Anemone BARINADE

Barinade is by no means a difficult boss, but he is the first boss in the game who has a real chance at killing you.

In Barinade's first form, he is attached to the floor and ceiling by his roots and tentacles. His main attack in this form is to shoot bolts of lightning at you with the "satellite dishes" on his head. Z-Target the tentacles attached to the ceiling, and begin circling the boss. It doesn't matter what direction you choose to circle in, but stick with it. Changing course will result in you getting electrocuted. Destroy the tentacles attached to the ceiling with the Boomerang.

Once you have destroyed the tentacles attached to the ceiling, the boss enters phase two. The Baris attached to Barinade's base will detach and begin circling the boss in some kind of giant carousel. Dodge through the circling Biris, and stun the boss by striking it's base with the Boomerang. The Baris will release from their bonding to Barinade, and become vulnerable. Destroy them with your Boomerang. After a short time, the Bari will reattach themselves and begin circling again. Repeat until all of the Bari are destroyed.

The boss now enters phase three. This is essentially the same as phase two, except that the boss is now capable of moving about the room and the ring of Baris is much smaller and faster. Keep throwing your Boomerang at Barinade until it can penetrate the fast moving Baris, and it will stun him. Destroy the Baris. Be careful while destroying them, as the "satellite dishes" will resume their attacking.

Once all of the Baris are dead, then you enter the boss' final phase, in which you are finally able to damage him. Stun him with your Boomerang, then run into strike it's base with Jump Attacks. Watch out, however - the satellite dishes will keep on firing the whole time. After two Jump Attacks, Barinade will retreat into the ground briefly. Keep dodging the Satellite Dishes until he emerges from the ground, then resume stunning and damaging him. After five Jump Attacks, Barinade will be defeated.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    Heart Container :heart:
!!! success inline end "New Quest Item"
    Zora Sapphire

Take the Heart Container that Barinade leaves behind, then enter the ring of shimmering blue light. Ruto waits for you here, along with the Zora Sapphire. The ring will teleport you and Ruto outside. Ruto will give you the Zora Sapphire, but only if you agree to marry her. She doesn't give you much choice in the matter (if it makes you feel any better, you get out of the engagement later).
