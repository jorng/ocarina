The game's second dungeon, Dodongo's Cavern, doesn't make a huge leap forward in terms of concept, though there are many more puzzles to be solved and the dungeon takes much longer. The main goal of the dungeon is to open the large Dodongo's Skull in the rear of the Cavern's main chamber, where the boss resides. To do this, the player must first find a way to the catwalk above the Skull. Simple to describe, easy to do, but it's still a dungeon. Don't get sloppy.

## Antechamber

If you still haven't equipped your Hylian Shield, then do so now. The Deku Shield can get destroyed very quickly in this place.

Grab one of the Bomb Flowers to your right, and throw it near the cracked wall. The explosion will destroy the wall, revealing Dodongo's Cavern. Run forward into the large antechamber, and along the wooden flooring. Jump out to the large island in the middle of the embers. Dodge the  Beamos, and head to the right side of the room.

Grab the bomb flower in front of the large window, and quickly Z-target the Beamos enemy to the right of the Bomb Flower. Run at the Beamos, and throw the Bomb Flower at it. If you do it right, then the Bomb Flower should strike the Beamos on the head and cause the whole apparatus to explode. Grab another Bomb Flower and use it to blow open the sealed wall to the right of the Beamos. Go through the darkened tunnel to the next room.

## Lower Southeast Hall

Run forward a bit, and quickly kill the Baby Dodongos who come out of the ground. Be careful, though, as hitting them will cause them to explode. Move out of the way as quick as you can to avoid damage. Once the Dodongos are dead or have run away, keep following the hall. You will come to a place where another Baby Dodongo appears, as well as a sealed up wall. Stand next to the sealed up wall, and then kill the Baby Dodongo as it moves by it. The explosion will destroy the barrier, letting you access the door on the other side. If you screw up, you'll have to leave the dungeon and re-enter to reset the Baby Dodongos.

## Torch Room
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS018]

Kill the trio of Keese on the opposite wall. Watch out though; if they fly through the flame of the torch, they will catch on fire and deal additional damage (and also destroy your Deku Shield if you are still using it). Use the Hylian Shield to absorb their attacks and douse the flame. Kill the Gold Skulltula on the wall, take the token (you may need to use a backflip to reach it), and return to the Lower Southeast Hall.

## Lower Southeast Hall

Turn to the right and kill the respawned Baby Dodongos. Climb up the ledge and run to the other end of the room. Grab hold of one of the Armos Statues, and push it into place onto the gray switch. This will unlock the door. Jump up onto the ledge and enter the door.

## Southeast Passage

Z-target the Keese on either side of the room and kill them with the Slingshot. Break open the pots, take their contents, and head through the door on the other end of the passage.

## Lizalfos Nest (lower)

This room contains a new kind of enemy - the Lizalfos. These enemies usually travel in pairs, and take turns fighting their target (in this case, you). Don't bother chasing after them - they just run away. Wait for them to come to you. Luckily, all of their attacks are easily blocked using the Turtle Shield technique. After they've attacked, quickly swing out with your sword. Keep on playing the waiting game until both of the Lizalfos are defeated.

After the Lizalfos are dead, the door on the west side of the room will unlock. Go through it.

## Dodongo Breeding Ground

Run to the end of the passage, noting the sealed wall to the right. Behind it is a door to a room which contains a lousy Business Scrub who sells Deku Sticks for fifteen rupees a pop. You shouldn't be short on Deku Sticks at all, so ignore the wall unless you need one.

Run to the end of the passage, and kill the pair of Dodongos in the long room by running around behind them and attacking their tail. Watch out - they blow up just like the Baby Dodongos. Return to the entrance to the long room and light a Deku Stick on the torch. Use the flaming Deku Stick to light the three empty sconces along the room (each is very near to where one of the three Dodongos was). Once all three are lit, the door at the west end of the hall will open. Go through it.

## Antechamber
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

You are now inside the "window" you passed earlier in the Antechamber, the large room with the giant Dodongo's head. Run forward and step onto the switch, which will open the door on the far side of the room. Drop down out of the window. If you miss the switch, you'll have to go all the way back around and hit it again.

Run across the platforms and cliffs to the west side of the room. Before you go through the door you just unlocked, grab the Bomb Flower near the door and use it to blast open the sealed wall to the left of the Bomb Flower. Open the chest on the other side to find the Dungeon Map. Go through the door you unlocked, in the northwest corner of the room.

## Bomb Flower Room

Run down the hall and into the room. Note the large number of Bomb Flowers clustered around the iron pillar. Go to the south end of the room, and use the Bomb Flower against the oddly-colored wall to break open the sealed wall. Go through the opened wall and through the door.

## Armos Trap Room
!!! example inline end ":fontawesome-solid-map:{.map-brown} Dungeon Map"

This room contains three Armos Statues surrounding a chest. In order to reach the chest, you're going to have to destroy the Armos Knight in front of the chest. This Armos Knight isn't like the ones you've seen previously - this one will come to life if you touch it. To defeat it, grab a Bomb Flower, and drop it near the Armos Knight (don't throw it - drop it). Just before the Bomb Flower explodes, strike the Armos Knight with your sword to bring it to life. The explosion will kill the Knight, and he will begin spinning rapidly and flashing. After a few seconds, it will explode. Try to stay out of the Knight's range until after this time. Open the chest to find the Compass, then return to the previous room.

## Bomb Flower Room

Grab the Bomb Flower to your right as you come out of the door, and throw it directly between the two long lines of Bomb Flowers surrounding the Iron Pillar. The Bomb Flowers will all ignite simultaneously, moving the pillar to a lower level. If the Bomb Flower isn't thrown in the exact center of the lines, then it won't ignite properly.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS019]

Once the pillar has dropped, climb up the stairs it created to the top. There is a Gold Skulltula in an alcove here, but we won't be able to reach it until we come back later with the Boomerang. Go left or right at the top of the iron pillar, and follow the path as it winds around to the top of the room. Destroy the Skulltula and the Gold Skulltula hanging from the ivy, then climb up the ivy to grab the token. Drop back down and go through the door in front of the ivy.

## Pillar Room

This room has a pair of Fire Keese flying around it. Circle around the room, taking them out with the Slingshot. Use the Turtle Shield guard if a Keese starts to fly at you. Go around to the south side of the pillar, and note the ladder behind the Armos Statue. Pull the Armos Statue away from the ladder, and be careful not to touch any of the other statues - they are actually Armos Knights in disguise.

Climb up the ladder to the top of the pillar, and step on the switch to unlock the door in the east of the room. Go east to the next room.

## Antechamber

You're now very high up in the Antechamber, on the rear catwalks in the upper level. Run forward and along the catwalk. Run past or kill the Fire Keese, and leap over the gap in the catwalk. Run through the tunnel to the room on the other side.

## Blade Trap Room

This room is full of pillars, and has a number of blade traps which spring towards you if you enter their line of sight. Run between the line of pillars to the rear of the room, where there is a stone block set in the wall beneath a ladder. Climb onto the stone block, then up the ladder. Stand on the narrow ledge at the top of the cliff, and carefully turn around so that you can see the small platform. Jump out to it; you'll just barely make it.

Open the chest for a red rupee. Grab the Bomb Flower, and hold onto it until it is almost ready to explode. Then, throw it at the wall above the ladder to blast open the seal. Once the seal is destroyed, jump out to the opened tunnel and run through the tunnel to the next room.

## The Solo Eye Room

Shoot the golden eye above the circle of flames with your Slingshot, and the ring of fire will disappear. Jump across the now flame-free platform to the other side, and through the tunnel. Watch out for the Baby Dodongo's who will unearth themselves along the way. Go through the door at the end of the hall.

## Lizalfos Nest (upper)

This is the upper level of the Lizalfos Nest room (the lower level is off the cliff on the other side of the room). Kill the Lizalfos exactly how you did before; wait for the Lizalfos to come to you, block their attacks with the Turtle Shield technique, and attack with Jump Attacks. Once both of the Lizalfos are dead, the door to the west will open. Go through it.

## The Double Eye Room

This room is similar to the Solo Eye Room, but there are now two eyes you have to shoot. Begin by shooting the eye on the high wall, above the flames. The first ring of flames will disappear. Jump out to the platform, and look to the left to see another golden eye in an alcove. Shoot this with your Slingshot as well, and the second ring of flames will disappear, leaving you free to jump the rest of the way across. Run through the darkened tunnel to the next room.

## Blade Trap Room
!!! info inline end "New Item + Equipment"
    :bomb: Bombs <br />
    :material-sack:{.bag-brown} Bomb Bag x20

You're now in the upper area of the Blade Trap Room. Jump across the gap, and turn to the right to see a chest on an upper ledge. Jump up to the ledge and open the chest to find the Bomb Bag, which contains 20 Bombs. Turn around, and go through the tunnel to the right.

## Antechamber
You're back in the Antechamber, this time in the upper level near the front of the room. Step onto the switch directly in front of you, and one of the floating pillars below will rise to the top, giving you access to the upper level of the dungeon should you fall.

Run to the right, and head across the catwalk. Jump over the first gap in the catwalk, so that you are standing in between the two gaps. Using your new bombs, drop bombs through the gaps in the catwalk so that they land in the giant Dodongo's skulls eye sockets (press the C-Button assigned to Bombs twice to drop bombs). Igniting blasts in both eye sockets will cause the skull to open it's mouth, letting you access the last area of the dungeon.

Before you drop down and enter the Dodongo's mouth, run to the end of the catwalk and blow open the sealed wall. Open the chest for a replacement Deku Shield, or a blue rupee if you still have your old one. Drop down to the central platform in the Antechamber and enter the Dodongo's mouth. Enter the door inside.

## Back Room

Drop down into the large pit area. Kill the Fire Keese flapping around the room, then climb up the ledge to the east. Run through the darkened tunnel to the next room.

## Goron Graveyard

Run down the tunnel and follow it's curve to the left. Jump down into the pit on the other side of the tunnel, and watch out for the two Fire Keese who will come swooping in. Go to the left, around the barrier, and then to the right on it's other side. Run to the far wall, and jump up and over the small ledge. Go down into the pit on the other side. There is a sealed wall here. Climb up next to it and drop a bomb next to the wall to break it open. Go through the door on the other side.

## Armos Knight Room
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS020]

This room contains a single Gold Skulltula, behind an Armos Knight statue. Normally, you'd have to kill the Armos Knight to reach the Gold Skulltula, but not so this time. Kill the Gold Skulltula with your Slingshot, then carefully move forward to grab the token without touching the Knight.

Return to the previous room. If you do accidentally brush against the Armos Knight, use your Bombs to defeat him.

## Goron Graveyard

Drop down from the doorway, and climb up the ledge to the left. Watch out for the Fire Keese, who have respawned. On the ledge, climb up onto the brown block, then climb again onto the next ledge. Run to the end of the ledge, and jump down into the pit. Break the pots to find recovery items and a Fairy (put it in a bottle if you have a spare). Enter the darkened tunnel after you have pilfered the items.

## Backroom

Run to the end of the tunnel until you reach a brown stone block set into a track in the floor. Push the block off the edge to the floor below. Kill the Fire Keese in the room, then pull the stone block away from the wall. Once it's far enough away that you can move around to it's other side, push the block into the opening in the floor in center of the room, and the western door will unlock. Go through it.

## The Pit

Open the chest on the other end of the room to get some Bombs, then drop a Bomb onto the iron plate in the middle of the room. After the bomb explodes, the plate will disintegrate, letting you drop down the pit into the room below. Drop down.

## BOSS: Infernal Dinosaur KING DODONGO

King Dodongo is a very easy boss (arguably easier then Gohma, but it's a difficult argument). He has two main phases; one, where he lumbers around the room in a circle, and will breathe fire at you. Two, where he rolls up into a ball and ricochets around the room. In order to damage him, you must wait for him to begin inhaling in the first phase, and quickly throw a Bomb into his mouth. The bomb will explode in his stomach, stunning the King Dodongo for a few seconds. You are given only one sword swing when he is stunned, so make it a Jump Attack.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    Heart Container :heart:

After you have hurt Dodongo, he will begin his second phase. Stand on the edge of the lava or in one of the corners of the room to avoid his rolling attack. After the King Dodongo rolls halfway around the room, he will revert to Phase One, where the fight's pattern resets. After three Jump Attacks or six normal sword attacks, King Dodongo will die.

!!! success inline end "New Quest Item"
    Goron's Ruby

Grab the Heart Container he leaves behind, and enter the ring of light to warp back outside, where Darunia will give you the Goron's Ruby, and make you an official Blood Brother. From this point on, Darunia and all of the Gorons become huge Link fanboys. Darunia even ends up naming his son after you. Darunia also recommends that you visit the Great Fairy who lives on top of Death Mountain (which we will in a little while).
