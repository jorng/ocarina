## Zora's Fountain (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS034]

Before we continue on with our journey, we're going to be doing a ton of stuff. We'll be returning to just about every area we've visited so far, to claim (among other things) new Pieces of Heart and a large number of Gold Skulltula Tokens. If you want to skip all of this, then proceed to Hyrule Castle and follow the instructions that the game gives you. Once you've retrieved the Ocarina of Time from the Hyrule Castle Moat and learned the Song of Time, then head for the Temple of Time and scroll down to the part of the guide with the heading "Temple of Time."

If it isn't nighttime, play the Sun's Song to make it so. Climb up onto the large tree trunk which arches over the body of water in the south of the zone. Go to the west side of the tree trunk and look on the wall to see a Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token with your Boomerang. Head back through the cave entrance in the west side of the zone to return to Zora's Domain.

## Zora's Domain

From King Zora's Throne Room, go to the right and dive off of the waterfall. Swim down into the water and into the tunnel to Lake Hylia.

## Lake Hylia (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS035]

Swim back up to the shore, and go to the west a short ways to the observatory. Make it nighttime with the Sun's Song if you need to, then head around to the back side of the Observatory. Look on the rear side of the observatory from the wooden drawbridge to find a Gold Skulltula. Use the Boomerang to kill it and claim it's token. Head to Hyrule Field through the north exit.

## Hyrule Field

Head north and climb up the ladder onto the stone wall. Run along the wall and jump off it's other side, then go north until you reach the road. Follow the road northwest, and ignore any Peahat you may anger along the way. Turn left at the giant tree. Head into the quarry-like area, and go the north edge of it to find a circle of stones. Drop a bomb in the middle of this circle of stones to find a hidden pit. Drop down into the pit.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS036]

Use Din's Fire to burn away all of the webbing to reveal three alcoves with a Big Skulltula, a Cow and a Gossip Stone in each. Head for the alcove with the cow, and look on the wall in the rear of the alcove to find a Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token with the Boomerang. Return to the surface by entering the beam of light.

Go west to enter Gerudo Valley.

## Gerudo Valley (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS037]

Go west, and go halfway up the log bridge. Stop halfway along it. Make it nighttime with the Sun's Song if you need to, then turn to the right. Look just above the small waterfall to find a Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token with the Boomerang.

Head out to the drawbridge west of the log bridge and dive into the river. Ride it down stream back to Lake Hylia and use the underwater passage to return to Zora's Domain.

## Zora's Domain

Climb up to the path that leads to the front entrance, return to Zora's River, and ride it downstream back to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

Head for Kakariko Village, in the northeast corner of the zone, at 1:00 on the clock face. Before you enter the Village, go north from the stairs to find a lone tree in the very northeast corner of the field. Place a bomb on the north side of the tree to blast open a pit. Drop down.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS038]

Run to the end of the pit and kill the Big Skulltula. Look high on the wall, where a Gold Skulltula rests on a bit of webbing. Kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token with your Boomerang. Return through the beam of light to Hyrule Field, enter Kakariko Village and head for the House of Skulltula.

## House of Skulltula
!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :fontawesome-solid-sack-dollar:{.bag-brown} Giant's Wallet

Speak with the man in the rear of the room, and he'll award you for killing 30 Gold Skulltulas with the Giant's Wallet. This is the largest wallet in the game, which can hold up to 500 rupees. Leave the house back to Kakariko Village and head for the Graveyard.

## Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS039]

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to. Head for the southeast corner of the graveyard, to the far south end of the second row of gravestones. Look high on the wall to see another Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token with the Boomerang. Now, head for the northwest corner of the graveyard where there is a soft patch of earth. Plant one of your Magic Beans there. Return to Kakariko Village.

## Kakariko Village

From Kakariko Graveyard, take a right up the long staircase. Enter the door on the right at the top of the stairs, behind the crate to enter the Windmill.

## Kakariko Windmill
!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP17]

Look to the left as you enter to see a Piece of Heart high on a ledge. Get closer to it and use the Boomerang to snag it. Remember to use Link's head as a targeting reticule. Return to the Village and go to Death Mountain Trail.

## Death Mountain Trail

Re-equip your Hylian Shield if you're not using it already. Start heading up the trail and enter the mouth of Dodongo's Cavern. Plant one of your Magic Beans in the soft patch of earth, then enter the Cavern.

## Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

If you like, use Farore's Wind at the start of the dungeon so that you can warp right back to the start as soon as you have claimed the Gold Skulltula.

There are still two Gold Skulltulas in this dungeon which you are yet to reach, and we're going to get one of them right now. The other, we're going to have to return even later for. To reach this Skulltula, we're going to have to go through part of the dungeon in reverse order then the first time you were here. You're going to do this by using the elevator in the Antechamber to reach the second floor. It isn't so bad, it'll be over real quick.

Head into the main chamber, out to in front of the giant Dodongo's head. Board the moving platform on the right and ride it to the top. Get off on the second floor, and enter the tunnel opposite the plaque.

## Dodongo's Cavern - Blade Trap Room

Jump off the cliff to the right as you enter the room to drop down to the bottom level. Dodge the blade trap and climb the ladder near the southwest corner of the room. Go through the tunnel back to the Antechamber.

## Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

Cross the wooden bridge and enter the door on the opposite side. Kill any Fire Keese who bother you.

## Dodongo's Cavern - Pillar Room

Kill the Fire Keese, then pull aside the Armos Statue blocking the ladder on the south side of the room. Step on the switch on top of the pillar to unlock the doors, then leave through the north door.

## Dodongo's Cavern - Bomb Flower Room
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS040]

Go left or right around the perimeter of the room, being careful not to fall. If you do, you'll have to loop all the way back around. Climb up the ivy walls to the top of the iron platform. Look into the alcove on the north side of the room, and use the Boomerang to kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token. Drop down to the bottom floor and leave the Dungeon. Return to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

Head southwest to Lon Lon Ranch. Enter the Ranch. Be careful of passing too close to Hyrule Castle, unless you want to progress the game's plot ahead of where this guide is.

## Lon Lon Ranch (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens x2 :material-spider:{.gold-token} :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS041] [GS042]

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to. Head towards the arch leading into the field, and stop to look at the second story window on the left building. Kill the Gold Skulltula on the window, and take it's token with the Boomerang. Head out into the field, towards the southwest wall, to the right of the mill. Kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token with the Boomerang, then return to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

If you've been skipping the Happy Mask Trading Sequence, then start heading for Hyrule Castle now and skip the next two paragraphs. Unfortunately, if you have been skipping out on it then you're going to miss a Deku Nut upgrade and 500 easy rupees. Another bad thing: this 500 rupees is going to be contributed to buying the remaining Magic Beans that you still need to buy.

If you want to catch up on the Happy Mask trading sequence, then there's a special subchapter for it. Return to the table of contents to find the Find Code.

The man we're looking for is now running in a wide circle around Hyrule Field. He sticks primarily to the road and runs counter-clockwise, so if you do the same and run clockwise then you'll quickly find him. You now must chase him until he stops running - he takes periodic breaks, and the Sun's Song is no help. Once he has stopped, speak to him while wearing the Bunny Hood, and he will give you 500 rupees for it. If you don't have the Giant's Wallet yet, then you're going to miss out on the majority of these. Once you have sold the Bunny Hood, head for Hyrule Castle.

!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :material-ocarina: Ocarina of Time

Head for the gates to Hyrule Castle, which will remain firmly shut in either daytime or nighttime. When you get close enough, a cut scene will take place. Zelda and Impa will race out of the gates, and Zelda will do a really fantastic John Elway impression by throwing you the Ocarina of Time, which will land in the moat. You then get your first face-to-face encounter with Ganondorf.

!!! info inline end "New Song"
    :material-music: Song of Time

After the cutscene is over, dive into the water of the moat to get the Ocarina of Time, at which point Zelda will contact you telepathically and teach you the Song of Time. When you emerge from the telepathic contact, you will be back out front of Hyrule Castle. Enter the castle and go to the Happy Mask Shop.

## Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop
!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :fontawesome-solid-masks-theater: Mask of Truth

Speak with the mask trader, and pay him fifty rupees for the Bunny Hood. You have now finished the entire Happy Mask Trading sequence, and can borrow any Mask that you want from the store. For now, take the Mask of Truth, which lets you get hints from the Gossip Stones around the world, and also gets you a Deku Nut upgrade. Head back to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

Now that your Giant's Wallet is overflowing with rupees, it's time to spend most of them on Magic Beans. Return to Zora's River, in the eastern part of Hyrule Field at the 2:00 position on the clock

## Zora's River

Return to the Bean Man and buy out the rest of his beans. Go all the way to the eastern edge of the river, near to the entrance of Zora's Domain. On the way, stop off at the Musical Frogs and play them the Song of Time to make back fifty rupees.

Once you reach the entrance to Zora's Domain, look to the right of the waterfall, where there is a deep pool of water. Swim to it's bottom, and enter the tunnel at the bottom to warp to Lost Woods.

## Lost Woods

Get out of the pool, and go right through the log tunnel, then take a left through another log on the other side. Defeat the Business Scrub on the right as you leave the tunnel, then make him leave by refusing his wares. Drop a Bottled Bug into the patch of soft earth to reveal a Gold Skulltula (if you didn't get it last time you were here), and remember to recapture one of the three bugs that appears. Plant one of the Magic Beans, then head for the large tree in the back of the clearing. In the grass, there is a cluster of butterflies. The butterflies are actually hovering over an invisible hole. Drop down into this hole to enter the Forest Stage.

## Forest Stage
!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    - Deku Nuts x40

Put on the Mask of Truth, then step forward. The Deku Scrubs down here will stare at you. Go and speak to their Chief (the Scrub with the "mustache") on the right side of the  room, and he will increase the number of Deku Nuts you can carry. Enter the beam of light to return to the Lost Woods.

## Lost Woods

Run forward through the log tunnel, and go right at the crossroads on the other side. Go right again at the pool of water, and left at the stone arch. Turn right again at the next crossroads, and go straight at the next. Enter the tunnel in the southwest corner of the next area. Drop a Bottled Bug into the patch of soft earth to get the Gold Skulltula (if you didn't get it last time), and remember to recapture one of the bugs who comes out. Plant one of your Magic Beans in the patch. If you still haven't bought the Deku Stick Upgrade from the Business Scrub in the rear of this valley, then do so now.

Turn around, and go back through the log tunnel. Hang a right and go through the next log tunnel, then go to the right to enter Kokiri Forest.

## Kokiri Forest
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS043]

Jump down to the bottom level of Kokiri Forest and head for the shop on the east end. Look for patch of soft earth behind the shop. Drop a bug in it (remember to recapture one), and kill the Gold Skulltula that appears. Take it's token, then plant the Magic Beans. You're done planting Beans for a while.

> If you bought all of them from the Bean Man, then you should have two left. It will be a very long time before you get rid of both of them.

Head for the Deku Tree in the east side of the area, and enter the dungeon. It's time for one last Gold Skulltula.

## Inside the Deku Tree - The Trunk

If you like, use Farore's Wind at the start of the dungeon so that you can warp right back to the start as soon as you have claimed the Gold Skulltula.

Drop down the hole in the middle of the first floor to reach the sub-basement. Climb up onto the stone block on the north side of the room, jump onto the upper ledge, and crawl through the tunnel on the west side.

## Inside the Deku Tree - Small Nest

Run around the room in a wide circle to attract the attention of the Gohma Larva hanging on the ceiling. Kill the Larva, then light a Deku Stick on the torch and use it to burn through the webbing in the northwest part of the room. Kill the Deku Baba on the other side, then bomb the sealed wall. Open the door on the other side.

## Inside the Deku Tree - Hidden Room
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS044]

Kill the Big Skulltula against the wall, then turn around and face the door. On the right of the door is a Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token using the Boomerang, then leave the dungeon and return to the Hyrule Castle Market.

## Hyrule Castle - Market

Go to the Temple of Time. It's to the right of the Happy Mask Shop.

## Hyrule Castle - Temple of Time Exterior

Go around the path and enter the Temple of Time.

## The Temple of Time

You'll find another one of those strange platforms here. Run forward to the black obelisk pedestal with the red carpeting in front of the Door of Time. Stand on the red carpeting, take out the Ocarina of Time and play the Song of Time.

The three Spiritual Stones, together with the Ocarina of Time and the Song of Time, will open the Door of Time. The Triforce above the door will glow, and the gateway to the Sacred Realm will be open.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :material-sword: Master Sword

Run through the door, where you will find a pedestal which contains a Sword in a Stone. This is, of course, the Master Sword. Draw the Master Sword from it's pedestal.
