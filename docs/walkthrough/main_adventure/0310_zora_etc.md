## Hyrule Field

We're now headed for Zora's River. It's a small passage at the 2:00 position in Hyrule Field, a short ways upstream from Kakariko Village. The entrance is the same pond that Link stops Epona at to drink in the game's demo sequence on the title screen.

## Zora's River

!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS024]

!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :beans: Magic Beans

Run forward a few feet, and Kaepora Gaebora will stop you to barrage you with another wall of text. After he's gone, roll into the tree to make a Gold Skulltula appear. Kill it and take it's Token, then bomb the stones blocking the path. Follow the river upstream until you reach an iron gate. Speak to the fat slob-like guy, and buy as many Magic Beans from him as you can. They become progressively more expensive as you buy more; just keep buying them until you go broke.

Plant one of the Magic Beans in the patch of soft earth next to the Bean Man. Don't bother dropping a bug in this one; this is the only earthy patch in the game which doesn't have a Gold Skulltula. Run back a ways to where the river bends. There is a patch of dirt here, and a patch of dirt on the other side, indicating where some kind of bridge used to exist. Jump across the gap to reach the other side of the river.

Keep going upriver, and ignore the Octorok who appears. Jump over the small gap in the river, then run up to where there is a small hill on the left. Run up this hill, and jump over the small gap. Hang a right, then run until you hit a wall, then go right again. Drop down off the cliff here, then run forward. There is a log leading into the river here; carefully jump onto the log, and walk slowly to the edge of the log where there is a small, white circle. Stand on this circle, and pull out your Ocarina.

Play the Frogs each of the four songs that you have learned so far (Zelda's Lullaby, Epona's Song, The Sun's Song and Saria's Song). The frogs will award you with fifty rupees for each song. After you have played all four songs, return to the Bean Man and keep buying Magic Beans from him until you go broke again. To reach the Bean Man, just jump into the river and ride it downstream, and get back onto dry land at the shallow part on the left near the Octorok.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP11]

You were probably only able to buy five or six beans. This is okay; we'll come back later to buy the rest of them once we have the Adult's Wallet. From the Bean Man, turn around. You'll see a Cucco running around a circle of rocks. Grab the Cucco, and return to the Musical Frogs. You'll see a Piece of Heart sitting on a pillar on the way; this is what we're going for with the Cucco.

From the Musical Frogs, run forward, and throw the Cucco up the cliff. Immediately jump up and grab it quickly - if it runs into the water, it will disappear and respawn back at the beginning of the area. Turn to the right, and run into the river (it's shallow enough that you won't be swept away). Throw the Cucco up to the next cliff level, and quickly jump up after it and grab it before it goes into the water. Run to the south edge of this cliff, where there is a small waterfall. If you look downstream, you will see a small ledge sitting just above the water line. Jump out holding the Cucco, and glide down to the ledge. Throw the Cucco away; we won't be needing this one anymore.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP12]

Climb the ladder. At the top, note the Cucco running around. Grab it, and run to the northern edge. Jump over to the cliff with the Gossip Stone on it, then turn to the west to see the tall pillar with the Piece of Heart on it. You'll have to jump out with the Cucco, and land on the pillar to get the Piece of Heart.

Grabbing the Piece of Heart will make you drop the Cucco, who will probably run away. The bad news is, we need a Cucco still. Jump into the river and ride it downstream back to the beginning of the area. Grab the Cucco near the Bean Man, and return to the small waterfall (where we leapt off to reach the small ledge).

With the Cucco over your head, run to the east, across the shallow riverbed and up the hill. Go across the wooden bridge, and around the corner where you will find a large waterfall. Take a right up the zigzagging path, and jump down to the lower path. Go to the right, up and around, and then to the left, across the plaque, until you hit the wall. Look to the left, and you will see another Piece of Heart. Leap off with the Cucco over your head, and you will glide out to the Piece of Heart (which should complete your eighth Heart Container).

!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS025]

You're done with the Cuccos now. There's still one more Gold Skulltula Token to get before we enter Zora's Domain. If it's daytime, play the Sun's Song to make it night (time passes normally in this zone, so you won't warp back to the entrance). From the platform that you picked the Piece of Heart from, drop straight down, where you will see a ladder rising from the river bed to the zigzagging path. A Gold Skulltula climbs on it. Kill the Skulltula with the Slingshot, and climb up the ladder to take it's Token.

From the top of the ladder, go around the zigzagging path, and stand on the plaque before the waterfall. Play Zelda's Lullaby, and the waterfall will retract, letting you access the doorway behind it. Jump over to the doorway and go through to enter Zora's Domain.

## Zora's Domain

Hug the wall on the right, and keep following the path until it splits to the left and right. Go left. At the top is the King Zora, who has to be one of the fattest fish-persons you'll ever see. Look to the left as you enter his "throne room," and you'll find a torch. Light it with your Deku Stick, and quickly run back down the stairs and light the torch you find there with the Deku Stick. Pull out a new Deku Stick, and light it again.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP13]

Run down the stone path, and take a left down the path we passed earlier. Light the burned-out brazier next to the cave mouth around the corner, and keep going forward through the shallow water to light another brazier. Put away your Deku Stick, and run to the left to a small alcove behind the waterfall, where there are two more braziers. Use Din's Fire to light them both. If you did it fast enough so that you lit all the braziers without any of them burning out, then a chest will appear behind the Waterfall which contains a Piece of Heart.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, return to the King's Throne Room. Run down the tunnel to the left of the king, and at the end you'll find a Zora. Play the Diving Minigame with him for 20 rupees (you need it's reward, the Silver Scale, to progress). If you don't have twenty rupees, then return to the Zora's River area and ride downstream to pick up invisible rupees from the riverbed.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :fish: Silver Scale

The Diving Minigame is relatively easy. The Zora will throw a handful of rupees off the waterfall, which you need to dive down and grab. Simply position yourself above the rupees, and hold down A as you dive down to grab them. Once you get better at it, you can grab multiple rupees in one dive. Once you have grabbed all of the rupees from around the waterfall, the Zora will call down for you to return to him and he'll give you a reward. He'll give you the Silver Scale, which doubles how deep you can go in a single dive.

Once you have the Silver Scale, dive off the waterfall again, and head for the area slightly south of the waterfall. There is a tunnel under the water here. Dive down and enter this tunnel to warp to Lake Hylia.

## Lake Hylia

!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :jar: Bottle #3

There's a ton to do here in Lake Hylia, so let's get through it quickly. The first thing, is to swim a short ways south from where you emerge from the tunnel from Zora's Domain. On the floor of the lake, near a ruined pillar, there is a Bottle. Dive down and grab it. You'll find that the Bottle already contains a Letter! This is actually the SOS sent by the Princess Ruto, who is trapped inside Lord Jabu Jabu, the Zora demigod. You're going to want to take this back to King Zora, but not immediately. There's still plenty to do here.

Swim north, back to the shore, and head for the east coast, where there are two small gardens with two scarecrows in them. Show the Scarecrow in the lower garden your Ocarina, and he'll ask you to play a song for him. Play the easiest eight-note song you can come up with, and don't play any of the songs you have learned or will learn later. Make sure the song has at least two different notes. Write this song down somewhere; you're going to need it later.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS026]

Head west to the tall building, and look for a patch of soft earth near it. Release a Bug from your Bottle near the patch of earth (remember to recapture one), and kill the Gold Skulltula that appears. Take it's token, then plant one of your Magic Beans. Go around to the west side of the building, and cross the wooden bridge that stretched across the Lake.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS027]

Ignore Kaepora Gaebora here; he'll give you a lift to Hyrule Castle, but you don't want to be going there. Keep going along the wooden bridge to the large island with the ancient dead tree on it. You'll also find another one of those mysterious platforms, like the one you saw in the Sacred Forest Meadow. Look east from the tree, and you'll see a small island with two pillars on it. Swim out to this island, and change the time to nighttime. A Gold Skulltula will appear. Kill it and take it's Token.

Look to the north, where you will see a small island. Swim to the island, and enter the door built into the wall.

## Lake Hylia - Fishing Pond

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP14]

Speak with the Clerk to the right, and pay him 20 rupees to play the Fishing Minigame. He'll explain the fishing process to you.

In order to win the Piece of Heart, you have to capture a record breaking fish: nine pounds. There really isn't much advice that can be given for this. It's all about patience. Z-Target a fish, then hit B to cast. Use the B button, the A button and the joystick to play with the lure and attract fish to the fly. The biggest fish are found near the submerged log on the left side of the pond and the reeds on the right. Once a fish is on the line, hold down A and pull backwards on the control stick to reel the fish in. With that information in hand, get fishing.

Once you have captured a nine-pound fish (minimum), return to the Clerk and show him your fish. He'll give you a Piece of Heart. Leave the Fishing Pond.

## Lake Hylia

We're going to take a quick detour over to Gerudo Valley while we're here. There's never really any reason for Young Link to ever go there aside from the optional upgrades you can get there, so now is a good time as any as while we're in the neighborhood.

Head north out of Lake Hylia to return to Hyrule Field.

## Hyrule Field

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP36]

Climb the ladder onto the wall on the left. Run along the wall, and jump off to the right at it's end to land in the center of the small fenced-in corral. After Kaepora Gaebora is done telling you what a Lake is, move to the exact center of the corral and drop a bomb to reveal a pit. Use the Stone of Agony with the Rumble Pak to find it easier, if you have one. Drop down into the pit that appears, and defeat the Business Scrub inside. The Scrub will offer to sell you a Piece of Heart for ten rupees. That's not a typo. Ten rupees. Buy the Heart Piece, then return to Hyrule Field.

Jump out of the corral, and head northwest until you hit the road. Ignore any Peahats who you may attract on the way. After another meeting with Kaepora Gaebora, go west into a rocky, canyon-like area. Keep going west through the canyon until you reach the zone break to Gerudo Valley.

## Gerudo Valley

Run forward a short ways, and along the log bridge. Grab the Cucco on the other side of the log bridge, and then run to the edge of the canyon. Look to the opposite side of the canyon, and try to spot a small platform with a wooden crate on it. Once you have found it, jump out to it with the Cucco.

Glide slowly down to the crate, and then toss the Cucco into the wall. Roll into the crate to destroy it, and immediately pick up the Cucco again. If you do it fast enough, then the Cucco won't have time to jump into the river. If you miss it, then you'll have to jump down into the river, ride it downstream to Lake Hylia, and then return to Gerudo Valley so you can get another Cucco. Fun!

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP15]

Grab the Piece of Heart that was in the crate, which will cause you to drop the Cucco again. Hurry through the Piece of Heart victory text as fast as you can, and quickly pick up the Cucco again. If you miss it, then you'll have to jump into the river, ride it downstream to Lake Hylia, and then return to Gerudo Valley so you can get another Cucco. Fun!

From the platform with the Piece of Heart in the crate, face north, where you will see a narrow strip of land far below. Jump off, hugging the left wall. Ride the Cucco all the way down. It's a long way, but just be patient. Once you touch down on the narrow strip of land, toss the Cucco against the wall, as far away from the river as possible. You're still going to need it in a moment. Head for the southern edge of this strip of land, look for the patch of soft earth near the Cow.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS028]

Release some Bugs near the patch of soft earth. Remember to recapture one of the three bugs that comes out. Kill the Gold Skulltula that appears, and take it's Token. Plant the Magic Beans in the soft earth, then grab the Cucco. If it has run off the edge into the river, then you'll have to dive into the river, which will take you down to Lake Hylia, and run all the way back around to Gerudo Valley, so you can grab the Cucco again. Fun!

!!! info inline end "New Upgrades"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart [HP16]

Once you have the Cucco and are back on the stretch of land, run to it's northern edge. Look behind the waterfall, and you will see a ladder. Jump out to the ladder, and don't drop the Cucco until you're pressing your face right up next to it. Luckily, there is no current in the area immediately behind the waterfall, so you can climb up onto it if you fall in the water. Climb to the top of the ladder, where you will find another Piece of Heart. Take it, then jump into the river and ride it downstream to return to Lake Hylia.

## Lake Hylia

Swim to the submerged ruins near the shore, to the east of the Observatory and the west of the Scarecrows. Dive into the water and swim into the tunnel to return to Zora's Domain.

## Zora's Domain

Return to King Zora's Throne Room, and show him the Bottled Letter. He'll then, uh... "move" aside, and beg Link to save his daughter from Jabu Jabu's Belly. We'll get to that in a moment. For now, return to the bottom level of Zora's Domain, and go to the area of shallow water near the waterfall. Catch one of the fish who swim around here in an empty Bottle. Return to King Zora's Throne room, and go on the narrow path on the right side of the chamber to reach his throne. Go through the tunnel behind his throne to reach Zora's Fountain.

## Zora's Fountain

!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS029]

This area is largely structured around the Zora Demigod, Jabu Jabu. We'll get to him in a moment; for now, swim to the island in the very southeast part of the Fountain. Roll into the tree to find a Gold Skulltula. Kill it and take it's token. Drop a bomb between the two boulders against the wall, and the wall will explode open revealing a massive cave opening. Go through the cave to find your third Great Fairy's Fountain.

## Great Fairy's Fountain

!!! tip inline end "New Quest Item"
    Farore's Wind

Run forward to the fountain, stand on the Triforce emblem and play Zelda's Lullaby to make the Dominatrix appear. This time, you'll get Farore's Wind, a spell which lets you set checkpoints in Dungeons. You'll probably use it exactly zero times in your entire quest.

Once you have Farore's Wind, leave the Fairy Fountain.
