## Name Registration Page

Begin the game by entering your name into the Name Registration Page, then select the new entry from the menu.

## Introduction

Watch the introduction, which introduces the game's main characters. Once Navi the Fairy has awoken Link from his nightmare, then the game has truly begun.

## Link's Tree House

Head out the door in the northwest corner.

## Kokiri Forest

On Link's porch, you will be approached by Saria, one of the game's more important sub characters. Jump down the ladder and speak to her. Follow the road from Saria north, and then to the east. Jump across the small pool of water to the large arch that leads to the Great Deku Tree. Speak with Mido, the Kokiri who blocks your path. He'll refuse to let you pass until you find both a Sword and Shield (a task which he thinks is impossible, but we'll soon prove otherwise).

Turn around and return to the area near Link's Tree House. Go west along the path, then take a right up the hill. Enter the fenced in area (which is known collectively as the Kokiri Training Ground), and work your way to the back to the south wall. Enter the small tunnel by standing in front of it and pressing A. Crawl to the tunnel's other side.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    - [x] Kokiri Sword

On the other side, turn left. Wait until you see a large boulder roll by you, then immediately follow the boulder's path around the corner to the right, then another left, then take another right. Open the treasure chest sitting on the tree trunk to find the Kokiri Sword. Equip it on your Equipment submenu. Next item on your list is a Shield, which you'll have to buy from the shop for 40 rupees. There is also a Deku Stick Expansion which can be bought in the Lost Woods, which also costs 40 rupees. So your goal, at the moment, is to find 80 rupees.

Slash the bush behind the chest, which may drop a rupee. Turn around, and wait for the boulder to roll by. Run left and into the small alcove. Take the blue rupee and slash the bush, and take the rupee that it may or may not drop. Turn around, and wait for the boulder to roll by again. Run left around the corner, then another left. Take the blue rupee in the far alcove, then slash the bush which should (hopefully) yield another Rupee. Crawl back into the tunnel and return to the Kokiri Training Ground.

On the outside of the tunnel, Z-Target one of the rocks to the left. Begin performing backflips (hold back and press A) over and over until you reach the edge of the training ground. Run back towards the rock and repeat the backflips until you are awarded a blue rupee and a green rupee. Slash all of the bushes near the entrance to the Training Ground and take the rupees they should drop. From the entrance of the Training Ground, look north. The giant tree stump before you is Mido's House. Go inside.

### Mido's House

Open all of his chests for 11 rupees and a Recovery Heart. After you've robbed Mido blind, leave his house.

## Kokiri Forest

Jump up to the ledge behind Mido's House, and look behind his house to find another Blue Rupee. From where you emerge from Mido's House, look to the left to see a number of platforms resting in the water. Run directly at these platforms, and run across them. Link will automatically jump from each one as you run along them. If you do it properly, after you have reached the opposite shore of the water you will receive a blue rupee. Repeat this in the opposite direction to receive another blue rupee.

You've now obtained all of the blue rupees which are preset in the game. The rest must be obtained randomly from the Kokiri Children's houses or from the bushes around Kokiri Forest. The house in the southeast corner has the most rupees (six, look in the pots), and leaving then entering the house repeatedly will respawn the pots. Keep gathering these rupees until you have 80. Entering and leaving the houses will also respawn the rupees you can obtain by jumping across the platforms along the pond.

Try to enter the building in the northeast corner of Kokiri Forest. You will be stopped by a girl sitting on a balcony, who will give you a basic lesson in Z-Targeting. Follow her instructions if you need to learn, then enter the building.

## Kokiri Shop
!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    - [x] Deku Shield

Purchase a Deku Shield from the clerk. Equip it on the Equipment Submenu, then
leave the shop.

## Kokiri Forest

Head back to Mido's House in the northwest corner of the Kokiri Forest, then climb up on the ledge behind his house. Look for the wall covered in vines, then climb the vines to the top. Work your way around along the ledge and enter the large hollow log to enter the Lost Woods.

## Lost Woods

We'll be returning here several times over the course of the game, but you won't be able to do much on this first visit. Head left through the log. Ignore the two elevated logs; we'll get to them in the next visit. Head through the hollowed out log in the left corner of this area.

Take note of the patch of soft earth here; it will be semi-important later. Jump off the ledge to the floor below, and make your way to the back of the area. Z-Target the Business Scrub, who will probably retreat into the ground. Scrubs like to hide in the ground when you get too close to them. If you stand far enough away, though, they will reemerge and begin firing Deku Nuts at you. To beat this Business Scrub and make him sell you his wares, either reflect his Deku Nut back into his face with the Deku Shield, or do a Jump Attack.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    - [x] Deku Stick Maximum Capacity Upgrade #1

To perform a jump attack, begin by drawing your sword (B button) then hitting A. If you time it right and stand at just the right distance, the tip of your sword will connect with the Business Scrub just before he retreats into the ground. Speak with him, and he will upgrade the total amount of Deku Sticks you can carry to 20 for 40 rupees (and he'll maximize your Deku Sticks for free).

Return to the opposite side of the valley and climb the ladder back to the top. Go through the hollowed log, then hang a right into another hollowed log. Go left or right (it doesn't matter which) through another hollowed log to return to the Kokiri Forest.

## Kokiri Forest

Head to the east side of the area, back across the pond, and speak with Mido again. Now that you've lived up to his challenge to find a Sword and Shield, he'll let you pass. But he won't be happy about it. With Mido out of the way, enter the passage. Halfway through it, you'll encounter a bunch of Deku Babas. These guys die in one hit from your sword, and leave behind Deku Sticks. Kill them or dodge them, whichever you prefer, and make your way through to the Deku Tree's Clearing.

The Deku Tree will test Link and Navi, by having them enter his uh... mouth, and defeat the parasite that has been placed at his roots. Enter his mouth to begin the first dungeon.
