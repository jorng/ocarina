## Kokiri Forest

You will emerge back near the entrance to the Kokiri Forest township. Mido is once again blocking your path, so speak to him. Mido will blame you for the Deku Tree's death, the take off, presumably to sulk somewhere. Jump across the lake and follow the path to the western edge of Kokiri Forest. The Kokiri who originally blocked your path here is now gone, so you can exit through the hollowed log. Go through to leave the Kokiri Forest.

## Lost Woods
!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :material-ocarina: Fairy Ocarina

As you pass over the bridge leading to Hyrule Field, you will come across Saria. She accepts that Link is leaving, and gives him the Fairy Ocarina as a parting gift. The game will automatically zone you into the next area.

## Hyrule Field

Take a few steps forward, and simultaneously the best and most annoying character in the game will stop you: Kaepora Gaebora. He'll explain how to get to Hyrule Castle, and also how your map works. Make sure you tell him "Yes," you got all that, unless you want him to repeat the entire spiel.

Once KG flies away, run forward between the trees where the beginnings of a road appear. Follow the road to it's end to reach Hyrule Castle. Make sure you roll all the way (by continually pressing the A button as you run), otherwise it will be night time by the time you reach Hyrule Castle, and the gates will be closed. At which point you'll have to sit around for the next few minutes waiting for time to pass.

## Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)

Once you gain access to Hyrule Castle, immediately enter the gatehouse to your left as you enter.

## Hyrule Castle - Gatehouse (daytime) [GS004]
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS004]

Smash all of the pots in this room with your sword, then destroy the crates in the rear of the room by rolling into them. One of them contains a Gold Skulltula. Kill it, and take the token it leaves behind. Then leave the Gatehouse.

## Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)

Go southwest to the next area.

## Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

Head around to the opposite side of the fountain, and speak with the little girl in the white dress. This is Malon, another important bit character. After you've spoken with Malon, enter the building behind her with the large target over the door.

## Hyrule Castle - Shooting Gallery (daytime)
!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :material-sack:{.bag-brown} Bullet Bag x40

Speak with the rather large and hairy clerk, and agree to play the game. To win the Big Bullet Bag, you have to shoot every rupee that appears without missing a single one. If you miss two or less, then the clerk will let you try again for free. If you miss more then two, you have to pay to play again.

For this first run through the Shooting Gallery, the rupees appear in a preset order. The order is:

1. In the middle
2. From the left, then from the right
3. Jumps from the middle
4. From the left AND right
5. Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6. Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Keep playing the minigame until you successfully shoot all of the targets, and the clerk will award you with the Bullet Bag x40, which increases the ammo capacity of your Slingshot by 10. If you run out of rupees trying to complete the game, then return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse and smash the pots to replenish your supplies.

Bullet Bag in hand, return to the Market.

## Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

Leave the market through the passage directly behind Malon.

## Hyrule Castle - Garden (daytime) [GS005]
!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS005]

Run forward a short ways, where Kaepora Gaebora will appear again. Listen to his rant about guards, then when he flies away roll into his tree to make a Gold Skulltula appear. Now, you'll have to hang around here until it becomes nighttime. Once it does, head back to the Market.

## Hyrule Castle - Market (nighttime)

Run back around, towards the entrance to the Market from the Drawbridge. Run behind the little stall to the left, and you should coax a small white dog into following you. If you accidentally attract the attention of another dog, leave the area and re-enter it. Once you have the dog following you, run to the right and into the alley in the far right corner.

## Hyrule Castle - Back Alley (nighttime)

Enter the door second on your left.

## Hyrule Castle - Little Richard's House (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP01]

Speak with the big fat lady in this house, and she will recognize the lost dog
as her own. She'll reward you with a Piece of Heart for finding Little Richard
(good golly, miss molly!). Go back out to the Back Alley and return to the
Garden.

## Hyrule Castle - Garden

Malon should now be standing near a long vine on the wall to your right. If she isn't standing there, then you didn't speak with her back in the Market. You'll have to return there, speak to her again, then return to the Garden and wait for another Day/Night cycle to pass, then return to the Market, then return to the Garden, where Malon should have appeared.

!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :egg: Weird Egg, Chicken

Speak with Malon, and she'll explain that her father, Talon, went to the castle to deliver Milk, but hasn't returned yet. He probably fell asleep somewhere around the castle, and she asks that you go and find him. There's a catch, though; the guards in the Garden won't look to kindly upon some kid in a green fairy costume sneaking into the castle grounds. If they spot you, they'll grab you and throw you back outside the gate. Malon also gives you an Egg, for no apparent reason. You'll need the Chicken inside the egg to wake Talon, however, so accept it with gratitude.

Climb up the ivy wall to the top (it has some rough spots where if you don't climb up in just the right place, you'll fall off). At the top, run forward a bit, past the gossip stone, to the top of the large marble arch. Drop down to the ground on the other side of the arch, where you will land on the other side of the gate which formerly blocked your path. You probably don't realize it, but you've already snuck past two of the guards.

This next part is the easily the hardest part of sneaking through the Garden. You need to run up the hill to the left at an exact angle. There are three graphical breaks in the hill (thank god for N64's visible sprites, otherwise this would be nearly impossible to describe). The place you need to run up is the third break in the hill, approximately near it's center. Go straight up the hill, and at the top there is a cluster of flowers. Run straight at these flowers, then begin running forward and slightly to the left until you reach a wall. Part of the wall is tiled with some bricks; climb up these bricks.

At the top of the brick wall, run straight forward, past another gossip stone. Jump straight off the cliff, and go right into the moat. Swim down to the end of the moat until it breaks left, then climb up onto the small patch of dirt, and from there climb up to the stone platform. Run to the left from the stone platform, where you will find Talon fast asleep. If it turned from night to day in the time it took you to sneak past the guards, then the Egg that Malon gave you should have hatched into a Chicken. If it hasn't hatched yet, you'll have to stand around until it does. Stand near Talon so that Navi flutters near him, then use the Chicken to wake him up.

Speak with Talon, and he will suddenly remember that he left Malon behind. He'll run off, clearing the path for you to push the milk crates near Talon into position so that you can sneak in through the castle moat. Push both of the milk crates through the gap which was recently vacated by Talon. You can then climb onto the crates, and then jump over to the draining pipe which feeds the moat. If it's nighttime, then loiter around until it becomes daytime. You won't be able to sneak through the next area at night, as the guard is increased at night. Once it's daytime, climb through the drainage pipe to enter the next area.

## Hyrule Castle - Courtyard (daytime)

Jump to the left, out of the small fountain. Run to the left until the camera changes to a small garden, with a patrolling guard in it. Hiding behind the tall hedge to stay hidden from the guard (if you are seen here, you'll be thrown back to the milk crate area in the Hyrule Castle Garden). Wait for the guard to begin moving along the left side of the topiary in the center, then quickly run across the bottom edge of the topiary, and left until the camera shifts again.

Here, a pair of guards patrol a pair of fountains. Again, hide behind the hedge on the right side of the screen until the guards move into the proper configuration for you to run by. The time to run past, again along the bottom edge, is when the left guard is walking between the pair of fountains, and the right guard is walking along the upper edge of the right fountain. Run to the left until the camera shifts.

Try to ignore the rupees in the center of this topiary. They're tempting, but there actually isn't very many and the guard here guards them well. Instead, climb to the top of the topiary by going up the stairs, then slowly walk along the wooden beam which extends over the topiary. If you fall, it is possible to make it back to hiding if you're extremely quick, but not likely. On the other side of the topiary, run to the left until the camera changes once more.

Hide behind the stone wall until the guards move into the proper configuration to sneak by. This time around, wait for the left guard to begin walking along the left side of the statue, and for the right guard to begin moving along the upper side of the statue. Run to the left and take refuge behind another hedge.

Wait for both of the guards to pass along the left side of the topiary, and follow slowly behind the second guard as he moves along. Stop when he stops, move when he moves. As long as you stay directly behind him, he won't spot you. Once you reach the northern edge of the topiary, run through the arch to reach the center of the Courtyard, and the Princess of Destiny: Zelda.

Before you run up and talk to Zelda, there are two easter eggs in the courtyard you may want to check out. Shoot the window on the left side of the courtyard with your Slingshot, and a guard will throw a bomb at you. Look at the window on the right, and you'll see images of Mario, Peach, Bowser and Yoshi. Shoot this window for a red rupee. After you've done this, speak with Zelda.

!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :envelope: Zelda's Letter

Zelda will ask you if you have the Spiritual Stone of Forest. Even though you promised the Deku Tree you wouldn't tell anyone, it's okay to tell Zelda. Confirm that you have it. Zelda will then tell you about a dream she had, and offers to tell you an ancient story passed down by the royal family - but only if you don't tell anyone. Promise not to tell, and she'll basically repeat the ending to the Deku Tree's story. She will then mention the Ocarina of Time and the Temple of Time, then ask if you understand. Say you do, whether you do or not. Zelda will then stand aside and let you see Ganondorf in person for the first time (the dream sequence doesn't count!). Agree to look through the window, and Ganondorf will see you out of the corner of his eye. Zelda will then beg Link to help her save Hyrule from Ganondorf. Agree to help her, and she will give you Zelda's Letter. This will let you pass through the gate in Kakariko Village to Death Mountain.

!!! info inline end "New Song"
    :material-music: Zelda's Lullaby

Run towards the entrance to the courtyard, and you will find the way blocked by Impa, Zelda's attendant (basically, nurse/bodyguard). Impa will teach you Zelda's Lullaby, easily the most important and overused song in the game. Impa will then show you back outside to Hyrule Field, and point you in the direction of Kakariko Village. But we're not ready to go there just yet. Navi recommends that we go and brag to Saria about how we're going to save the world, which is actually a pretty good idea. We'll be making a quick stop at Lon Lon Ranch along the way as well.
