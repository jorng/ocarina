## Death Mountain Trail

Before you progress any further, now is the time to replace your Deku Shield with the Hylian Shield you should have picked up in Kakariko  Graveyard.  Do this on the Equipment Submenu.

Go forward a bit, and kill the Tektite.  If he tries to jump on you, do the Turtle Defense with the Hylian Shield (hold R).  Go around the corner and defeat two more Tektites.  You can vaguely hear a Gold Skulltula here, but you won't be able to reach it until you get access to Bombs.  Keep following the path up and around, and defeat another Tektite who jumps down from on high. Note the Piece of Heart high above the giant boulder - we'll get to it in a few minutes.

Go up and around the corner, and keep going up the path.  Watch out for the rolling Goron who crashes through here periodically.  Keep following the path until you reach a large wooden post with a red flag tied to it.  From here, you can go left to keep climbing the mountain, or go right to Goron City.  Go right.  Keep following the path, past the large stone pedestal with the ring of rocks, and enter the archway carved into the stone to enter Goron City.

## Goron City

There's a ton of hidden stuff in Goron City, but unfortunately you need Bombs to access them.  So for right now, we'll just have to stick to the task at hand.  Jump down to Goron City's lowest level.  Look for the sealed door with the carpeting in front of it.  Stand on the carpet, and play Zelda's Lullaby to make the door open.  Enter the room on the other side of the door to find Darunia, who will be very unhappy that you aren't the royal messenger, as he had believed.  Play Saria's Song while standing directly in front of him to cheer him up.

Now cheered up considerably, Darunia will listen to your story.  He'll mention that Ganondorf has already been by to find the Stone.  After Darunia refused, Ganondorf sealed up the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern, blocking off the Goron's primary food source.  Now, his people are starving.  But what's worse, Ganondorf also awoke monsters inside Dodongo's Cavern.  So even if they managed to open the cave, they'd be eaten alive just trying to be fed.

!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :material-crown: Goron's Bracelet

Darunia promises to give you the Spiritual Stone of Fire, but only if you can defeat the monsters in the cave.  He'll give you the Goron's Bracelet to help, which can be used to pick up and use Bomb Flowers that grow around Death Mountain.

Before you leave Darunia's Room, whip out a Deku Stick and light it on the torch in his cave.  Quickly run back outside, and use the flaming Deku Stick to light the empty sconce outside.  Swing your sword to put away the Deku Stick, then pull out another Deku Stick and light it again.  Use the flame to light all of the braziers on the bottom level of Goron City.  Once all the braziers are lit, then the giant pot in the middle of the room will begin spinning. This is absolutely useless for now, but after we finish the next dungeon we'll be coming back to finish the puzzle.  You can also use the lit Deku Stick to ignite the Bomb Flowers near the sealed up room, which will blow open the wall and let you access the Goron City Shop (not that it has anything of real value to buy... yet).

Head up the stairs between the pair of yellow-striped posts to reach the second level of Goron City.  Run to the right, where you will find two unlit torched and a Goron sitting in front of a tunnel.  Run down this tunnel to see a long line of boulders surrounded by Bomb Flowers.  Pick up one of the Bomb Flowers, and drop it near the boulders to clear a path.  Go through to the end of the tunnel.

## Lost Woods

Welcome back to the Lost Woods!  It's time to unload that Skull Mask for the Happy Mask Trading Game, and get the second Deku Stick upgrade as well.  If you want to skip this section, then go down to the heading that reads "Goron City."

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS015]

Go left through the tunnel, then left again, then left one final time.  You'll be in a small clearing which is a dead end.  Defeat both of the Business Scrubs here, then look for the patch of soft earth near the right Business Scrub. Release your Bottled Bugs near the patch of soft earth, and recapture one of the bugs before they all disappear.  Kill the Gold Skulltula who emerges from the patch, and take its token.

Now, run to the large tree in the back of the clearing, and look for a cluster of butterflies in the tall grass.  These butterflies are actually gathered around an invisible pit.  Drop down into the pit to reach the Forest Stage.

## Forest Stage

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    - Deku Sticks x30

Put on the Skull Mask and take a few steps forward.  The Deku Scrubs in the stage will begin to cheer and mob you.  Run over to the right side of the room (facing from the entrance), and the Deku Scrub Chief will increase the number of Deku Sticks you can carry by 10.  Once you have the upgrade, enter the beam of light to return to the Lost Woods.

## Lost Woods

Leave the clearing through the log tunnel, then go right, right again, and then left.  Hang a right, then forward, and forward again.  You'll find yourself back by the Lone Skullkid.  If you haven't played Saria's Song for him yet, then do so now for the Piece of Heart he has.  Otherwise, speak to him while wearing the Skull Mask, and he'll buy it from you.  Unfortunately, he'll buy it from you for less then it's worth, so you're going to have to pay the difference next time you're in town.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS016]

Once you have sold the Skull Mask, enter the mouth of the log tunnel behind you.  At the edge of the cliff on the other side is another patch of soft earth.  Drop a Bottled Bug into the patch (remember to recapture one of the three bugs that pops out), and kill the Gold Skulltula who emerges from the earth.  Take it's token.  If you still haven't purchased the first Deku Stick Upgrade, then do so now.  It's at the other end of the valley.

Make your way back through the Lost Woods to the stone archway and return to Goron City.

## Goron City

Back on the second level of Goron City, go to the far left of the ledge and go up the stairs between the pair of red-striped posts.  When the stairs split left and right, go right.  At the top of the stairs, you'll find yourself on Goron City's top floor.  Go right from the stairwell exit, then right again the first chance you get to return to Death Mountain Trail.

## Death Mountain Trail

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP08]

Go around the corner to the right, where there is a small alcove with a Bomb Flower in it.  Pick up the Bomb Flower, and throw it off the cliff so that it lands on or near the boulder blocking Dodongo's Cavern.  It may take a few tries to get it right.  After the boulder is out of the way, then face away from the edge, and hold down Z (if you Z-target anything, then you won't be able to do this next part right, so make sure you're not targeting anything). Run backwards towards the edge of the cliff, and when you reach the fence, hold back and press A to backflip over the fence.  If you do it just right, then you'll land on the cliff above Dodongo's Cavern and be able to get the Piece of Heart.  This should complete another Heart Container, as well.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS017]

Drop down from the cliff, and enter the mouth of Dodongo's Cavern.  Stop to drop a bug in the patch of soft earth (remember to recapture one of the three who comes out), and kill the Gold Skulltula who emerges.  Take the Token, then enter Dodongo's Cavern.
