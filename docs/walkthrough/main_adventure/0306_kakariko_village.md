## Lost Woods

Kaepora Gaebora will ambush you again with his dreaded Long Winded Speech of Death attack. Shoo him away, then take a right through the hollowed log to return to Kokiri Forest.

## Kokiri Forest

Turn right back around and re-enter the Lost Woods.

    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP04]

Go left through the hollowed log, and jump onto the small trunk to interact with the Skullkid (and yes, this is the same Skullkid who unwittingly becomes the villain in Majora's Mask). Play Saria's Song for the Scarecrow Kid, and he'll give you a Piece of Heart (which should get you another complete Heart Container).

If you still haven't picked up the Deku Stick x20 Upgrade, then head through the tunnel in the rear of the area and get it now. Otherwise, go back to the Kokiri Forest, and return to Hyrule Field through the west exit.

## Hyrule Field

We're now going to take Impa's advice and head for Kakariko Village, whose entrance is in the very northeast corner of Hyrule Field (1:00 on the  clock face). Make your way directly there, and ignore any Stalchildren or Peahats you may anger along the way. Make sure that it's daytime before you enter.

## Kakariko Village (daytime)
!!! info inline end "New Item"
    :jar: Bottle #2

Run forward through the arch in front of the town, and immediately grab the Cucco (chicken) who is running around here. The first order of business in Kakariko is to gather up all the Cuccos around town and deliver them to the Cucco Lady, who will give you a Bottle for your trouble. Deliver the Cucco to the Cucco Lady, and throw it into her pasture. The Cucco Lady is found in the south-eastern part of town, near the partially constructed building.

Grab the next Cucco very near the Cucco Lady's pasture, near the arch leading to the Graveyard in the southeast corner. The next Cucco is in a crate near the center of town, across from the stairs leading to the upper level of Kakariko. The next Cucco is on the north side of town, on the upper level, near the gate that leads to Death Mountain. Grab the Cucco and return to the lowest level of town, but don't throw it into the stable yet.

Note the Cucco who is trapped on a ledge near the large tree in the center of town, which is blocked off by a tall fence. The fence can't be climbed, and the ledge is too high to jump up. To reach this Cucco, climb up the stairs to the partially constructed building, and jump off the edge towards the Cucco while holding another Cucco in your hands. The Cucco will help you float out to the ledge. Toss both Cuccos (the one you're holding and the one you just reached) off the ledge, then deliver both Cuccos one at a time to the pasture.

Grab yourself another Cucco from the pasture, since more floating is needed to reach the last two. Climb up the long stairset to the east of the Cucco Lady's pasture, and run straight to the edge, and aim yourself right at the elevated platform which is fenced off. If your aim is  precise, then you can make it over the fence. Toss the Cucco back over the fence so that it lands near the well (but not in it), then run down the stairs.

Being careful not to fall into the pit (doing so will reset the Cuccos in Kakariko Village, forcing you to start over from the beginning), grab another Cucco running around in the small grotto behind the building. Climb back up the stairs, and throw this Cucco over the fence so that it lands near the well (but not in it) also.

Drop back down into the grotto, then climb the tall ladder near where you found your most recent Cucco. Climb it all the way to the top, and work your way around behind the Windmill. Grab the last Cucco (sometimes it wanders over to the very top of the ladder you just climbed up), then jump off the cliff, heading towards the Cucco Lady's pasture. Throw your Cucco into the pasture, then grab the other two who should still be wandering around by the Well. Return them to the Pasture as well, then speak to Cucco Lady, who will give you a Bottle for your trouble.

But the Cucco Jumping Fun isn't over yet!  Grab another Cucco from the pasture, since we're now going to be gliding out to the rickety balcony which sits above the Cucco pasture. Climb the stairs to the unfinished building, then go around to the front side of the stack of bricks. Throw the Cucco up to the first level of the stack of bricks, then quickly climb up and grab the Cucco again before it has a chance to run off the edge. Repeat the process again on the second level of the brick pile.

Turn to the right, to the narrow beam which has the carpenter running back and forth along it aimlessly. Wait for the carpenter to reach the left side of the beam, then start going right again before you jump out onto the beam yourself. Run along the beam, and when you reach the corner where the beam bends to the right, leap off the edge and steer yourself right for the balcony. You'll just barely make it onto the ledge (in fact, you'll likely clip onto the ledge). Throw aside the Cucco and enter the crack in the building.

    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP05]

Take the Piece of Heart, then leave the way you came in.

## Kakariko Village (daytime)

Jump off the balcony and land back by the Cucco Lady. Head through the stone archway in the southeast corner of Kakariko Village to reach the Kakariko Graveyard.

## Kakariko Graveyard (daytime)
!!! info inline end "New Quest Items"
    Gold Skulltula Tokens :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS009]

Run to the right and slash the bushes to pieces, and take their contents. Pick up the rock as well, and capture one of the bugs that appear in a Bottle. Pass under the arch then follow the stone path to the left side of the graveyard, where there is a patch of soft earth. Stand near the patch of soft earth, and release the bug you captured (which has magically become three separate bugs). Quickly recapture one of the bugs in the bottle, while the other two will wander around briefly, then burrow into the soft earth. A few seconds later, a Gold Skulltula will appear. Kill it and take it's token, then head for the back of the graveyard where the largest tombstone is.

Stand on the large Triforce symbol burned into the grass in front of the tombstone, take out your Ocarina and play Zelda's Lullaby. The tombstone will literally explode, revealing a pit. Drop down the pit.

## Kakariko Graveyard - Royal Family's Tomb
!!! info inline end "New Song"
    :material-music: Sun's Song :sun:

Run down the ramp and run in circles around the large bone pit to attract the attention of all the Keese in the room. Pick them off with your Slingshot or with sword attacks. Once they are all dead, the door at the top of the stairset will unlock. Climb the stairs and go through the door.

Hug the left wall of this room and run to it's end. Ignore the attention of any Redeads you may attract on the way - for Young Link, it's easiest to avoid Redeads then to kill them. Enter the doorway on the opposite end of the room, and pass through the shadowy tunnel to find a large tomb.

Read the inscription on the tomb to discover the notes to the Sun's Song, which turns Night into Day and Day into Night. No more standing around Hyrule Field waiting for time to pass!  Return to the entrance to the tomb and enter the beam of light to warp back to the Graveyard.

Now that you have the Sun's Song, you also have access to a quick and easy 80 rupees. If you return to the entrance to Hyrule Castle in Hyrule Field, then climb up the chains on the gate, then you can play the Sun's Song. The gate will retract, letting you walk along the edge of the gate to claim four invisible red rupees. This is known as the "Sun's Song Rupee Trick," and I will reference it a few times throughout the guide.

## Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)

It's now nighttime, so you can interact with the gravestones around the Graveyard without Dampe's Fanboy yelling at you for it. Head for the front row of gravestones, and stand behind the grave with the flowers behind it. Grab a hold of it, and pull back to reveal a pit beneath the gravestone. Be careful pulling aside any other gravestones - they all contain Poe enemies, who become invisible when Z-Targeted. Drop down the pit.

## Kakariko Graveyard - Shield Grave (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Equipment"
    :material-shield-outline: Hylian Shield

Run forward and open the chest to find the Hylian Shield. This shield is WAY too big for Young Link to handle, but does let him curl up like a turtle and become pretty much immune to all damage. Which is cool. Stay on the Deku Shield for now, but once we get to Death Mountain we'll want to switch the Hylian Shield, whose metal is impervious to flame attacks.

Enter the beam of light and return to the Graveyard.

## Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)

Go to the rear row of gravestones, and go to the far right. Counting from the right to the left, pull aside the fourth gravestone to reveal another pit. Drop down the pit.

## Kakariko Grave - Redead Grave (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP06]

The Redead in this grave guards a Piece of Heart. Just go ape crazy on this Redead, attacking him repeatedly. The faster you attack him, the less opportunity he gets to attack you back. If he does manage to grab hold of you, tap buttons and rotate the joystick like mad to free yourself. Once the Redead is permanently defeated (it will make an extra loud SWIPE noise when it is), play the Sun's Song to make a chest appear that contains a Piece of Heart. Open the chest, take the Piece of Heart, and return to Kakariko Graveyard.

## Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :material-puzzle-heart:{.heart-red} Piece of Heart x1 [HP07]

It's now time to play Dampe's Heart-Pounding Gravedigging Tour to find another Piece of Heart. Dampe takes a circular route around the graveyard, following the path. If you stand directly in his path, then he will stop. In one of the twelve dirt patches dotted around the graveyard, there is hidden a Piece of Heart. In order to find the Piece of Heart, stand directly on that dirt patch so that way Dampe will stop directly in front of it, then speak to Dampe and pay him 10 rupees to dig up that patch of dirt. Most of the dirt patches contain at the very least some rupees. Keep playing the game until you dig up the Piece of Heart. The Piece of Heart randomly changes places every time you leave the zone, so if you have to leave to restock on Rupees, then just start over from the beginning.

If you go broke, then return to Hyrule Castle and use the Gatehouse and the Drawbridge Trick to earn more rupees for the game. Dampe's Gravedigging Game only runs for the first part of the night, so if Dampe isn't there then you'll have to go hang around Hyrule Field until it becomes nighttime again, then return to the Graveyard. The Sun's Song won't work (it makes the time either noon or midnight, and the Gravedigging Tour is open during neither time). Once you have the Piece of Heart, return to Kakariko Village.

There are a ton of Golden Skulltulas to find and kill here in the dead of night. The first is at the Unfinished House, on the pile of bricks. Kill it with the Slingshot before trying to jump up and grab the token (the sword will cause you to take damage because of the extreme close range). The second Skulltula can be found on the building directly to the west of the Unfinished Building (the House of Skulltula). It sits directly beneath a window on the left side of the building.

The third Skulltula can be found by rolling into the tree near the center of Kakariko Village. The fourth can be found on top of the tall observation tower on the upper level of Kakariko Village. Shoot it with the slingshot before climbing up the ladder to claim it. The last of the Skulltulas can be found in the northern edge of the village, on the north side of the building closest to the Death Mountain Gate.

Head back to the lower level of Kakariko Village, and enter the House of Skulltula (the single-story building next to the unfinished building).

## Kakariko Village (nighttime)
!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    :fontawesome-solid-sack-dollar:{.bag-brown} Adult's Wallet

Enter the building, and turn to the right. Speak to the man, and he will reward you with the Adult's Wallet, the award for killing 10 Golden Skulltulas and claiming their tokens. Return to Kakariko Village.

## Kakariko Village (nighttime)

Go to the northern edge of the village and speak with the guard by the gate. He will refuse to let you through to Death Mountain Trail. Show him Zelda's Letter, and he'll let you through, though he'll think it's all a big joke. He will request, however, that you return to the Hyrule Castle Market and pick up a Keaton mask for him. This is the first step of the Happy Mask Trading Sequence, the Young Link trading game. It's entirely optional, and doesn't directly reward you with anything of any particular use (indirectly, you do get a Deku Stick and Deku Nut upgrade apiece), but if you're a completionist you still might want to do it.

If you choose to do the Happy Mask trading sequence, then keep following this guide from this point. Otherwise, skip down to the Death Mountain Trail heading.

Head back to Hyrule Field, and enter Hyrule Castle and into the Market.

## Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

The Happy Mask Shop is now open for business. It's the small building near the Temple of Time, to the right of the entrance to the Hyrule Castle Garden. Enter the building.

## Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop (daytime)

    :fontawesome-solid-masks-theater: Keaton Mask

Speak with the Happy Mask Salesman at the counter, who will explain the process of the Happy Mask trading game. You will now be able to select masks from the shop windows as though you were buying them from a regular shop. Select the only one available, the Keaton Mask, and return to Kakariko Village.

## Kakariko Village

Return to the guard by the gate to Death Mountain, and speak to him while wearing the Keaton Mask. He'll pay you 15 rupees for the mask. Now, you've got to go back to Hyrule Market to the Happy Mask Shop, so you can pay the 10 rupee fee for the mask. Isn't this Happy Mask sequence FUN!?

## Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop (daytime)

    :fontawesome-solid-masks-theater: Skull Mask

Pay the 10-rupee fee for the Keaton Mask, and then borrow the Skull Mask. We'll sell this one in a little while; for now, let's continue with our journey and start up Death Mountain. Leave the shop and return to Kakariko Village.

## Kakariko Village

Head to the northern gate, and go through to Death Mountain Trail.
