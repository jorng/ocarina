The game's first Dungeon, Inside the Deku Tree, follows one of the simplest formulas of all of the dungeons in the game. The main body of the dungeon is the interior of the Great Deku Tree's trunk, and all of the other rooms in the dungeon stretch out from this central area. The Trunk has four main levels: The Top Floor, The Main Floor, The Basement, and the Sub-Basement. In order to progress through the dungeon, you must find a way to break through the four different levels of the Trunk and into the Sub-Basement, where the dungeon's boss resides.

## The Trunk

!!! example inline end ":map: Dungeon Map"

Start by killing the Deku Babas in the corners of the room. Hold your shield up with R while Z-Targeting to absorb their attacks. Take the Deku Sticks and/or Deku Nuts that they drop. Slash the bushes against the northeastern wall, then climb up the ivy wall in the northern part of the room. Slash the bushes at the top, then run to the right along the platform, being careful not to fall. Open the chest part of the way along the ledge to find the Dungeon Map. Keep going right along the ledge and enter the door you come to.

## Scrub Room #1

Defeat the Deku Scrub by Z-Targeting him and reflecting the Deku Nut he fires
back into his face. The Scrub will then get up and start running around the
room. Don't chase him; go and stand on his nest. When the Scrub attempts to
return to his nest, he will walk right into you. He will then open both of the
doors in the room, and give you a useful hint for avoiding fall damage (press
forward on the joystick as you land). Go northeast through the door to the
next room.

## Slingshot Room

!!! info inline end "New Item + Equipment"
    - [x] Fairy Slingshot
    - [x] Bullet Bag x30

Jump out to the gray platform, but quickly jump to the next ledge, as the
platform will quickly begin to fall. Open the chest to find the Fairy
Slingshot (and the Bullet Bag x30 which goes with it, though it isn't mentioned
in-game). Turn to the right and climb the ivy wall. Open the chest for a
Recovery Heart. Turn around and look down, towards the door that you came in.
Using the Fairy Slingshot, shoot down the ladder that hangs above the door.
Jump down and climb up the ladder, then go back through the door. Return to
the Trunk through Scrub Room #1.

## The Trunk

Go back along the ledge to where you opened the chest for the Dungeon Map. Use
the Slingshot to shoot down the three Skullwalltullas clinging to the ivy wall.
Once they are out of the way, climb the wall to the top, and then to the left
to reach the highest level of the Deku Tree.

Jump off the ivy wall when you are over the top ledge. Ignore the Big
Skulltulas who drop down, and keep going to the left until you reach a door.
Go through it.

## Compass Room

!!! example inline end ":compass: Compass"

Turn to the right and step on the switch next to the lantern. The three platforms in the center of the room will begin to rise. Quickly jump along them to the ledge in the back of the room. Open the chest to find the Compass. Kill the Deku Baba for a Deku Stick if you don't have one (you're going to need one in a moment). Drop back down off the cliff and return to the room's entrance. Use the ivy wall in the northwest corner to climb back up.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS001]

Step on the switch again, and this time use the platforms to reach the small alcove in the northern part of the room. Jump past the Big Skulltula and open the chest for a Recovery Heart. Kill the Gold Skulltula in the back of the alcove to get the game's first Gold Skulltula Token. Skulltula Tokens can be redeemed at the House of Skulltula in Kakariko Village for rewards. Some rewards are good, some are just plain awful. You won't be able to Z-target the Skulltula - this is normal. The tokens, however, are Z-targetable.

Jump back down to the pit in the center of the room, and climb back up to the door. Use a Deku Stick near the lantern, and it will catch on fire. Use the flaming Deku Stick to light the burned out lantern, and the door will unlock. Go through the door.

---------------------------------
## The Trunk

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS002]

Run to the right, past the first Big Skulltula. When you reach the second one, kill it by Z-Targeting it, and waiting for it to spin around. Use a Jump Attack when it does this. You're now going to have to jump off the edge and land on the bit of webbing, clear down on the first floor of the Trunk. It may take a few tries to get your aim precise, but it isn't difficult. If you land right on the webbing, you will break through it into the sub basement level of the Trunk.

!!! info inline end "New Quest Item"
    Gold Skulltula Token :material-spider:{.gold-token} [GS003]

You'll land in a pool of water. Climb up onto the ledge in the southeast corner of the room (to your right as you land). Step on the switch to activate the lantern. Use your Fairy Slingshot to kill the Gold Skulltula on the grating on the eastern side of the room. Jump out from the ledge to reach it, then climb back up onto the ledge. Face the long ivy wall that you fell down to reach this area, on the south side of the room. Kill the second Gold Skulltula, and climb up the wall to claim the token.

Climb back up onto the southeast ledge once more, and open the chest behind the lantern to find a Recovery Heart. Light a Deku Stick on the lantern, then quickly jump out onto the pond so that you land on the shallow bit which Link can stand on without having to swim. From there, jump to the southwest ledge, run past the Deku Baba and use the flaming Deku Stick to burn the webs on the wall, revealing a door. Go through this door.

## Scrub Room #2

Defeat the Scrub in this room by deflecting the Deku Nuts he fires back at him with your Deku Shield (the Slingshot doesn't work, he just retreats back into the ground). Once he starts running around the room, run to his nest and stand on it. When he tries to return to his nest, he'll run right into you, thus defeating him. He'll mention that "23 is number 1," which is actually a hint to solve the last puzzle before the boss.

Shoot the Silver Eye above the west door with the Fairy Slingshot to unlock the door. Go through the door to the next room.

## Trap Room

In this room there is a large floating platform which passes over the pool of water you need to get over. The catch is, there is also a large spinning pole covered with spikes which blocks the platform's path. To circumvent this obstacle, jump into the pool. On the left side of the pool, against the wall, directly beneath the rotating spikes, there is a button. Swim over this button, then press and hold down A to swim down and touch the switch.

Once the switch is activated, the water level in the pool will lower considerably. Quickly swim back to the room's entrance, and jump out to the floating platform. Hold down the R button to make Link crouch as you pass under the rotating spikes. On the other side of the pool, jump from the floating platform to the opposite ledge.

Kill the Big Skulltula, then move to the left side of the large stone block. Follow Navi's instructions to push the block all the way to the right, then jump up onto the block, then jump up to the door. Go through the door.

## Torch Room

Kill the Deku Baba in the center of the room, then light a Deku Stick on the lit torch. Use the flame to light the two un-lit sconces, which will open the door in the north side of the room. Go through it.

## Small Nest

Kill the Big Skulltula, then run to the center of the room. Run around in circles in the center of the room, which will provoke the Gohma Larva hanging from the ceiling to drop down. Kill them with single Jump Attacks, but avoid their charge attack. You know they are about to perform this when their eye turns red.

Ignore the bit of webbing in the northeast corner; we'll get to it later in the game. We can't do much there at the moment. Light a Deku Stick on the torches near the north part of the room, and use the lit Deku Stick to burn the webbing in the south part of the room. Enter the tunnel and crawl through to the other side.

## The Trunk

Run to the left, and push the stone block along it's carved path and off the cliff. Jump down, and go back to the southeast platform with the torch. Light a Deku Stick on the torch, then jump back to the stone block. Climb back up to the upper level, then run to the webbing covering the floor. Roll over the webbing by running at it and pressing A. The torch will make contact with the webbing as you roll, burning it away. Drop down the new hole to the lowest level.

You will land in a pool of water. Swim north to the shore, where three Deku Scrubs will attack you. If you remember the hint from Scrub Room #2, then this will be an easy puzzle. If you forgot, or weren't paying attention, then you have to kill them in order. The middle one is first, the one on the far right goes second, and the one on the left goes last. Striking the first two will only stun them; the last one, however, will run around the room just like the previous Deku Scrubs you've fought. After you hit him, run and stand on his nest. When he tries to return, he'll bump into you and give up. He'll also let slip the Dungeon Boss' secret: she is only vulnerable while stunned.

After the three Deku Scrubs have disappeared, the door will unlock. Go through to the game's first boss.

## Boss - Parasitic Armored Arachnid GOHMA

Run to the center of the room, then go into First-Person view (C Up) and look towards the ceiling to begin the boss fight.

Fighting Gohma is actually very similar to fighting a gigantic Gohma Larva. The only real tricks she has over these basic enemies is considerably more health, the ability to climb walls, and the ability to create Gohma Larva to distract you. Defeating Gohma is rather easy (and can, in fact, be done by only stunning her twice if you know how to do it properly). To stun Gohma and make her vulnerable to basic sword attacks, you must shoot her in the eye with the Slingshot while her eye glows red. As soon as the fight begins, immediately Z-target Gohma. Gohma usually immediately begins her charge attack, so immediately shoot her in the eye with the Slingshot, then begin using Jump Attacks (remember to swing your sword at least once before trying to do a jump attack). After one or two attacks, Gohma will run away and crawl up the ceiling.

Keeping Gohma Z-Targeted, try to keep yourself positioned so that you can see her eye even while she is on the ceiling. At this point she will begin spawning Gohma Larva, who will drop down to fight you. If you can shoot her in the eye before she is able spawn them, however, then she will fall to the floor and be stunned for a VERY long time. You can easily get in three or four more Jump Attacks at this point, which are more then enough to shut down Gohma permanently. If you miss, then kill the Gohma Larva, at which point the boss' pattern resets.

!!! info inline end "New Upgrade"
    Heart Container :heart:

After Gohma is dead, take the Heart Container that she leaves behind, and enter the shimmering blue circle. You will be teleported back outside the Deku Tree, who will ask you to listen to his story. Agree, and listen to the story (pay attention; it's very important to the game's overall storyline).

!!! success inline end "New Quest Item"
    Kokiri Emerald

Afterwards he will inform you that even though you were successful in defeating Gohma, he is still going to die. He gives Link the Kokiri Emerald, and makes one final wish: to seek out the other Spiritual Stones and prevent the "Evil Man from the Desert" (Ganondorf) from entering the Sacred Realm. As his last piece of advice, the Deku Tree tells Link to go to Hyrule Castle and seek out the Princess of Destiny.
